TODO: combine this with blender_wishlist.txt at home.

Big things:
- Constraints as nodes, or in general a node-based rigging system, which can still be abstracted by the old constraint interface.
- Combining shape keys with a node system (I vaguely know what I mean by this but not really - think hundreds of corrective shape keys interacting with each other. It's currently set up with a bunch of drivers and it's super finicky.)
- Also let us control shape key values within the same node graph as bone constraints.
- Let armatures be aware of every object they deform.
- Deprecate armature layers and bone groups and replace with a new system.
- Rebuild the data structure of how vertex groups(and maybe shape keys) are stored. (A weight container is the same thing as a traditional Weight Map in that it stores weight values for vertices, but it is separate from the mesh and is an item of its own.)

Medium things:
- Mask for Surface Deform modifier
- Physics bones?
- Let me snap bones to other bones(not just the head or tail but anywhere in between) - and consider bbone splining

Small things:
- Thicker/brighter edge drawing for bone shapes (Or edges in general)
- Head/Tail sliders should interpolate BBones correctly
