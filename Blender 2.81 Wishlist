    talk to Jacques about his plans for rigging with nodes
    talk to Sebastian about what his role is going to be in 2.81 and 2.82

Big things:
- Constraints as nodes, or in general a node-based rigging system, which can still be abstracted by the old constraint interface.
    - I want to access the result of a constraint and do maths on it, without actually applying that result to my transforms. I guess that's pretty fundamental and may be obvious, but there you go.
    - In this setting it might not make sense to refere to these pieces of logic as "constraints" anymore. They are more like Solvers. You ask them what transformation needs to be performed on a bone to achieve a goal, and they give you a result.
    - The way they arrive at this result also doesn't have to be a black box. There could be atomic nodes that let you do simple vector, matrix and quaternion maths, and these Solver nodes could be built out of these atomic nodes. The Solver nodes would basically just be pre-created node groups.
    - I can think of very few things that would need special atomic nodes, like IK and maybe Shrinkwrap.
- Combining shape keys with a node system (I vaguely know what I mean by this but not really - think hundreds of corrective shape keys interacting with each other. It's currently set up with a bunch of drivers and it's super finicky.)
- Also let us control shape key values within the same node graph as bone constraints.
- Let armatures be aware of every object they deform.
- Deprecate armature layers and bone groups and replace with a new system.
- Rebuild the data structure of how vertex groups(and maybe shape keys) are stored. (A weight container is the same thing as a traditional Weight Map in that it stores weight values for vertices, but it is separate from the mesh and is an item of its own.)
- Granuralize(that's a word) bone transforms further in the dependency graph. Two bones should be able to aim at each other without a dependency cycle, since only their rotation is dependent on their location. But as far as they're concerned right now, their transforms are dependent on each other's transforms.

Medium things:
- Mask for Surface Deform modifier
- Physics bones?
- Let me snap bones to other bones(not just the head or tail but anywhere in between) - and consider bbone splining

Small things:
- Thicker/brighter edge drawing for bone shapes (Or edges in general)
- Head/Tail sliders should interpolate BBones correctly
- Ctrl+0,1,2 to set subsurf levels should work in weight paint mode on the weight paint object.

VERY small things:
- Child Of constraint should automatically Set Inverse when a new target is chosen.
- It should be easier(I'm not even sure it's reliably possible at all) to set the inverse of Child Of constraint through python.
- How come Normalize Vertex Group and Normalize All Vertex Groups are separate operators, whereas Clean Vertex Group and Clean All Vertex Groups is one operator?

Bugs:
- Mask modifiers can have a severe performance impact when they have drivers on them, which could be relevant to production rigs with switchable accessories or clothes.
