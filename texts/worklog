March
    Mar 16:
        - Set up my Blender user preferences, VSC workspaces, git repos, CoffeeRun SVN at home. RapidSVN crashes on checkout, so I'm trying an SVN extension for VSC for now. (Which might be more convenient, if it turns out to be good)
        - Building Blender from source was failing, so I fixed that... I forgot how god damn slow it is on Windows though, so I'm honestly better off downloading the nightlies.
        - Campbell prompted me to write a giant wall of text for improving the hotkey editor. I made sure he will have regrets. developer.blender.org/T68884#892054
        - Got access to Notion and looked through the pages that seemed important ðŸ™‚
        - Started writing some documentation/tutorial/readme type thing for CloudRigify.

    Mar 17:
        CoffeeRun:
        - Re-generated crowd, hailey and sunny rigs after a refactor that caused all Rigify parameters to reset to their defaults. This time, without making everything explode.
        - Fixed some deformation and clipping on Hailey's chest with the wedding dress.
        - Fixed an issue on the Drape rig where the ribbon wasn't inheriting rotation from the root.
        CloudRigify:
        - cloud_bone: Implement create_deform_bone parameter. (Was needed for the drape)
        - Human Metarig now saves bbone scale, object name and object data name correctly.
        - Human Metarig no longer uses Rigify components, such as raw_copy, and uses cloud_bone instead.
        - Human Metarig no longer contains an outfit properties bone, because that relied on custom properties to function, and Metarigs don't save custom properties atm.
        - Figured out how to ensure that CloudRigify can simply be downloaded from github as a .zip, and that .zip can be installed in Rigify as a featureset package.
        - Had to re-organize and clean up the repository a fair bit.
        - Worked a bit on the README. Tried adding images but it was quite clunky, so I added some gifs where needed, which I think work pretty well. Good thing I'm working from home cause I'm not sure how I would've done this without ShareX...! Might still need some help with Markdown to make it a bit prettier, but from what I googled, it might not be possible.

    Mar 18:
        CloudRigify:
        - Added rig samples to some rigs, ensuring they can be generated on their own. Rig samples are examples that can be spawned in edit mode in the Rigify UI.
        - Fixed a bug where limb rigs could not be generated without a spine rig.
        - Improvements to parent switching setup so it doesn't rely on assumptions about available parents.
        - Fixed a bug in cloud_bone where the ORG- bones weren't constrained to the control bones.
        - Fixed a bug in cloud_bone where DEF- bones weren't created.
        - Burned probably half the day hunting down this bs developer.blender.org/T74888
        CoffeeRun:
        - Rigged a book
        - Updated Hail to latest cloudrig.py so Pablico can use IK snapping. 

    Mar 19:
        CoffeeRun:
        - Tiny hailey fix for Julien, some prop copies for Hjalti, another small tweak on the drape rig for Pablo.
        - While testing some rig generation stuff I tweaked some deformations on Hailey's waist and pregnant belly.
        CloudRigify:
        - Fixed a bug in cloud_bone where targetless constraints would fail to be re-targetted, since, they don't have a target.
        - Decided it's okay to add buttons to pre-existing Rigify UI, so I can now have custom generator settings.
        - Added Regenerate All Rigify Rigs operator that gets registered when CloudRig is loaded... I can't get unregister() to be called when it gets deactivated though, which is an issue.
        - CloudRig is no longer dependent on my MetsTools addon, so now is the first time it should really work straight off of github.
        - Refactored some code responsible for adding things to the Rig UI.
        - (Unrelated) Parameter UI is now organized in menus that can be closed. 

    Mar 20:
        CoffeeRun:
        - Fix crash for Pablico
        - rename some directly linked stuff from coffee to crowd_coffee. (unrelated to crash)
        CloudRig:
        spline_ik:
        - Found a workaround for the bug I reported the other day, so spline_ik rig works again.
        - Fixed a bug that caused the first and last handles to have the wrong length.
        - naming changes(deform bones, curve object)

        - Finish adding new drop-down UI to remaining rigs (spline_ik, spine)
        - Finish adding rig samples to remaining rigs (cloud_bone, spline_ik, chain, fk_chain). 

    Mar 23:
        Rain: Some weight tweaks on Rain's scarf and waist.
        CloudRig: Implemented support for arbitrary number of spine and neck bones into the spine rig.

    Mar 24:
        Day off due to eye problems.

    Mar 25:
        CoffeeRun: Rigged a tree.
        CloudRig:
        - Started splitting out code from cloud_limbs rig into a more generic cloud_ik_chain rig, which the limbs rig now inherits from.
        - Started some refactoring on cloud_chain code to make it more extendable.

    Mar 26:
        CloudRig:
        - More splitting out code from cloud_limbs into cloud_ik_chain, but still more to do before it's fully independent from cloud_limbs.
            - cloud_ik_chain can now be generated on its own for the first time(without relying on being inherited by cloud_limbs)
            - cloud_ik_chain now owns code for generating stretching setup, without breaking footroll on limbs. Still only supports a chain of 3 bones.
        - Add and implement various new parameters for IK chain:
            - Arbitrary chain length (WIP)
            - Pole target can be disabled, use first bone's rotation instead. This will assign a bone shape, group and layer to that bone.
        - Implement ability to hide parameters of inherited rig elements. I gave this a go before but it was a lot uglier than this new solution.
        Blender:
        - Tested and gave some feedback on the new experimental Menu Search (T74157)

    Mar 27:
        CloudRig:
        - cloud_ik_chain now fully supports IK stretch with an arbitrary length IK chain.
        - (TODO) Implement Custom IK Pole parameter  so the IK pole can be placed arbitrarily via the metarig.
        - (TODO) IK/FK snapping works on arbitrary length IK chain.
        Rain:
        - Fixed some missing drivers on subsurf modifiers that caused FPS to be cut in half.
        - Deleted new verts and replaced them with a masked Solidify modifier. Updated Rain v2.0.zip on Dropbox.
        Settlers:
        - Experimented with curves and stuff.

    Mar 30:
        Settlers:
        - More experimenting with curves and stuff, research
        CloudRig:
        - (For Settlers) Started planning and prepping code for a new kind of curve-based rig, but this time it would take a pre-existing curve.
            I would like the existing Spline IK rig to share code with this, since that one is curve-based as well, but it's a tricky code surgery, like when I was separating the IK Chain rig code from the Limb rig code.
        - Added short descriptions to all rig types to improve usability. They are displayed above their parameters.
        CoffeeRun:
        - Made pregnant Hailey's pants shorter.
        - Re-proxied all Haileys and Sunnys again in Hjalti, Pablo & Assembly files. This was needed because apparently bone custom properties don't update on proxies.

    Mar 31:
        CloudRig:
        - Curve rig is done, and shares code with the SplineIK rig.

April
    Apr 1:
        Settlers:
        - Experimenting with body rigging, extended discussion on the deformation of arms and legs, with an actual conclusion!
        CoffeeRun:
        - Rig Hailey's hospital gown
        - (make copies of Sunny with Julien's changes to the scrub)
        CloudRig:
        - Fix many small bugs that cropped up while testing things for Lunte.
        - Fix some tooltip inconsistencies and poor wording.

    Apr 2:
        Settlers:
        - Experimenting a lot with https://developer.blender.org/D6894 because it opened up a new possibility to do character deformations.
        I think it will be useful in the future, but for Settlers we pretty much want as many bones as there are vertices in the character, so abstracting the shape any further won't be of use
        - Trying to add extra stretch controls for Pablo but the geometry is limiting.

    Apr 3:
        Settlers:
        - Finished implementing the face rig after much pain.
        - Cleaned up the file
        CloudRig:
        - Added a generator parameter to run an arbitrary script file at the final stage of generation.
        - Fixed various bugs relating to curve rigs
        - Added a separate rig element specifically for Settler Mouth, which extends the basic Curve Rig. In the end this was only used to hook up a second curve to the hook bones, the same way the first curve is hooked up. Still, could be useful in the future.

        Some extra work in mega-overtime(non-stop till 6 am)
        - Fixed foot roll when stretching(Hailey & Lunte)
        - Work on automatic universal IK pole placement and IK angle determination. Works in most cases, but not quite all.

    Apr 4 (Saturday):
        CloudRig:
        - Finish IK pole magic. This allows me to remove a couple of parameters, to make the rig generator easier to use.
        - Move parent switch setup code from limb rig to ik_chain rig so any generic IK chain can have the feature. Made the code more general, and hacked around an issue.(in an okay way)
        - Fix choosing "Chest" as the IK arm parent not working when spine is on FK.
        - Fix error when IK/FK snapping when the IK rig doesn't use a pole target.
        - Fix unneccessary object/collection hiding in Curve rig, although it's still screwing up things on Lunte right now for some reason, even though I haven't touched it since yesterday, and then it worked fine... HMMMMM.
        Lunte:
        - Add shoulder bones to all limbs on Pablo's request
        - Experiment with a way to allow the hand to be rolled into a fist. Works okay but now need to code it.
        - Clean up weight painting.
        - Finalize surface deform usage on the arms. It's only used to a small extent, but it helps with deforming the ring.
        - Also attempted the same thing on the legs but for no discernable reason, it deformed like total crap compared to the arm, so I just cleaned up the weights as much as I could.
        - Hacked a fist roll thing and a backpack bone into the generated rig, just to test, I guess.

    Apr 6:
        Lunte:
        - Made face resistant to scaling (the curve objects now use a smarter setup and a few extra drivers to help adjust their width and length based on the head's world scale)
        - Tried my damndest to add support for the bevel object that Julien made for the mouth, but it's just impossible. There is no way to control when Blender decides the curve should just flip out.
        - Added some shading helper bones for Simon.
        - Helped Pablo troubleshoot a weird thing which I think is a bug with linked curves. It might come up again.
        - Added teeth to the rig, they are shrinkwrapped to the head and can be hidden individually with a custom property.

        - Helped Jeroen test some (welcome!) Weight Paint Overlay changes
        
    Apr 7:
        Lunte:
        - Came up with a solution to make the rings not stretch when the limbs are stretched, on Vivien's suggestion.
        - Rigged the tongue.
        - Rigged the hair.
        - Made some "smear" meshes for Pablico to append, duplicate and sculpt for smearing effects.
        - Added a parent for the top and bottom teeth.
        CloudRig:
        - Reworked how cloud_bone works, in that instead of cloning the ORG- bone, it just renames the ORG- bone... Not sure why I didn't do this before, it avoids many headaches.
        - Started adding support for custom prefix/suffix separators (currently it's hardcoded that bone names prefixes must be separated by - and suffixes by .) - still WIP though.
        - Started implementing a more robust way to manage Bone Groups and layers, but I'm not too confident on the design yet.
        - Minor text fixes.

    Apr 8:
        Lunte:
        - Reworked the teeth on Pablo's suggestions.
        - Made a couple of cloud posts
        - He can now sort of make a fist(after generation, without fiddling with it)
        - Made the belt deform more solidly.
        CloudRig:
        - Worked on new BoneGroup system. It's starting to come together, now just need to change the code everywhere where I create a bone, and it should be working at least as well as the old shitty system was. Then I can start getting crazy with it.

    Apr 9:
        CoffeeRun:
        - Douse a fire on hailey's knees.
        Settlers:
        - Set up an animation file for Pablo
        - Rigged a cube for Pablo.
        - Figuring out how to set up some empties for Simon to control the 2D tongue. It's probably not perfect.
        - 150 FoV production quality livestream participation.
        CloudRig:
        - New bonegroup system is fully implemented, the old one still needs to be ripped out.

    Apr 10:
        Settlers:
        - Gabby shirt discussions and rig brainstorming
        - Came up with a new idea for the tongue locators for Lunte, and after a few iterations it seems to work a lot better than the old one.
        CloudRig:
        - Nuked code relating to old bonegroup system.
        - Started hijacking Rigify's bone group and layer UI, replacing it with my own, and implementing new features that use it.
        - Generated rigs can now have unified select/active colors, just like in regular Rigify. (except there's a lot less clicking and redundant data involved!)

    Apr 14 (day after Easter):
        Settlers:
        - Prepared a metarig for Gabby, but waiting until tomorrow to start actual rigging since modeling still seems to be underway.
        CloudRig:
        - Been further looking into the ability to call register() and unregister() functions when the CloudRig featureset is installed or removed, so I could cleanly add or remove operators and change or un-change UI panels, etc.
        - CloudRig now uses its own Generator(the class that governs the rig generation process). This is something I've wanted to do since the beginning but didn't know how.
        - Improvements to Regenerate All Rigify Rigs operator. (use a more generalized way of ensuring objects are visible - moved that code to cloud_utils, might be useful for rigs that have to work with curve objects)
        When I hijacked rigify's bone group UI, it made me realize I could also hijack the Rigify Buttons UI, which holds the generator operator. 
        So now, if the rig is a cloudrig, I just have my own generator operator, which calls my own generator class! 
        Shame I didn't think of this before. Keeping this compatible with regular Rigify elements is not top priority, but would be nice.
        This will allow me to remove a lot of hacks, starting with moving object name management out of rig elements, and into the generator code.
        More to come.

    Apr 15:
        Settlers:
        - Added performance and shrinkwrap settings to Lunte, made some performance optimizations, and we discovered the power of Simplify and its stupid defualt settings ;)
        - Added some more teeth bones for Lunte.
        - Basic rig for Gabby so Hjalti can start doing something with her.
        - Worked on Gabby's body and sleeve deformation for the most of the day. It's now ready for some feedback.
        CloudRig:
        - Added Copy Rigify Parameters and Mirror Rigify Parameters operators to speed up and make more consistent the workflow of creating metarigs.
        - Some small fixes

    Apr 16:
        Settlers:
        - Lunte: More teeth bones, put shrinkwrap constraints back, sub-controls for teeth on separate layer, face quality now affects mask subdivision, backpack can be detached.
        - Gabby: Initial face rig, working better than I ever dared expect.

    Apr 17:
        Settlers:
        Gabby:
        - Learned about and worked around T59106...
        - This also removed the error spam from the console
        - Tweaked curve rig code so it can name its bones better if it has a side(.L/.R)
        Lunte:
        - Troubleshooting an issue for Pablo. I fixed it, but for some reason it's not propagating to his file... :/ Never found out what the issue was, had to ask him to re-make his file.

        More Menu Search shennanigans https://developer.blender.org/T74157

    Apr 20:
        Spent the morning discussing developer communication(prompted by sudden commit of Menu Search) in #blender-coders, and then even more with William in DMs.
        Settlers:
        - Hair, ear and goggles rigged for Gabby.
        - Started rigging Phileas - didn't test deformation yet, just setting up metarig (and hunting down some CloudRig issues)
        CloudRig:
        - The rig UI and the custom script execution code was moved from the rig elements to the generator, so it is only executed once per generation, instead of as many times as there are rig elements in the rig.
        - Removed a bone transform locking functionality that was copied from the original Rigify generator, and removed the hack that I used to work around it. (Rigify would lock any bone whose name started with 3 capital letters...)
        - Last FK bone on limb rigs(wrist/ankle) no longer displays in the middle of the bone like the rest of the chain.

    Apr 21:
        CloudRig:
        - A bugfix and some tweaks on SplineIK rig so it works with pre-existing curves, and works better with cyclic curves.
        - Implemented a new feature in CloudRig on Hjalti's request, so curve rigs can have a separate radius control.
        - Reset rig transforms during generation, so the Hook modifiers for curve rigs(and potentially other things) don't mess up if the target rig was moved.
        Settlers:
        - Fixed an pupil clipping mess on Gabby, and added some extra bones on her for Simon.
        - Started weight painting the body of Phileas.

    Apr 22:
        CloudRig:
        - Fix curve rig failing to generate when using UI button instead of operator.
        - Force cloud_bone bones to not be on Quaternion rotation.
        - Properties bone is no longer created until it's called for.
        - Tried to implement a generator parameter to disable creation of the Root bone, but it resulted in a bit of a mess, so I reverted it for now.
        Settlers:
        - Finished first pass on the body, hair and backpack for Phileas.
        - Started on some experiments for the eyes... the squashed spheres are gonna be tricky.
        - Fixed parent switching bug in CloudRig that was also present on Gabby.
        - Fixed intersection issues on Gabby.

    Apr 23:
        Settlers:
        - Phileas eyes, mouth and backpack rigged. Still need to add more control over the eyelid.
        - Addressed some issues and feedback from Pablo on Phileas.
        - Added shrinkwrap on Lunte's face parts for Simon.
        - Fix Gabby's freckles disappearing on some parts of her face.

    Apr 24:
        Settlers:
        - Tweaks on Gabby for Hjalti.
        - Eyelids rigged for Phileas.
        - Major clean-up on Lunte:
            - Fix various types of console spam (all unreasonable, of course)
            - Renamed face bones such that they are symmetrical, which is something Hjalti requested on Gabby.
            - Scaling the face parts now scales the outer tube correctly.
            - Stretching the head now stretches the face parts.
        CloudRig:
        - Reworked cloud_bone rig so it's a lot more hacky but a lot more functional. Need to hack it more later.

    Apr 25 (bored on Saturday):
        Settlers:
        - Continued and committed cleanup on Lunte. Earlier I saved over lunte.rig.blend with lunte.blend, which broke our "pipeline". Fixed that, and made it compatible with our new "pipeline".
        - Also went over all existing files where he was posed or animated, and made them all link from lunte.blend instead of various other files that either didn't exist or didn't have up to date shaders.
        - Finished and committed improvements to Phileas's eyelids, mouth and hair, brought to you by the cloud_bone rework from yesterday.

    Apr 27: King's day

    Apr 28:
        Settlers:
        - Re-made the mesh for the smear ring rig from Hjalti. Now it's a straight line, which lets us slide the mesh along a curve, to give it that sonic the hedgehog legs effect.
        - Fixed an issue on Lunte that made the teeth shift away.
        - Add teeth dummies for Gabby. I did not add a tongue dummy because I felt like the 2D representation didn't give really any sort of idea of how the tongue will actually look - it seemed more distracting than helpful.

    Apr 29:
        Settlers:
        - Some more troubleshooting on Lunte's teeth misalignment. Finally fixed it for reals.
        - Worked on Phileas based on feedback from Pablo
            - Bigger spine control
            - Better eye control shape
            - Add eye target controls
            - Make eyelids hidable
            - Mask out back parts of the eyelid meshes
            - Made smear meshes
            - Fix Knees bend a bit inwards by default with IK
            - Remove teeth bones that are no longer needed, rename the rest so none of them end in .00x.
        Blender:
            - Submitted D7571 to fix the final piece of Lunte error spam.

    Apr 30:
        Settlers:
        - Hook up Face Quality property to stuff on Gabby, like on Lunte.
        - Some cleanup on the release file
        Phileas:
        - More split up smear meshes
        - Fix smear meshes depending on rig
        - Added a middle head bone
        - Added eye lattice controls

May
    May 1:
        Moved back to the office, set up new blender user prefs, git repos and SVN.
        Settlers:
            - Some parenting fixes on Gabby
            Phileas:
                - Tweaked spine location and weights, in an attempt to reduce the amount of squishing happening on the backpack strap.
                - Made eye lattice controls horizontal instead of vertical, and made them 4 rows instead of 3, where the middle 2 are owned by the middle bone.
                - Additional control for the mid-point of the backpack straps on the sides
                - Fix a bug with the eyes
        Cloudrig:
            - Fixed bug where regular rigs would fail to get parented to cloud_bone rigs.
            - Fixed a bug where Stretch To constraints would get "-nan m" for their rest length, breaking them.
            - Fix an issue with spine rigs when there is no head bone, the last FK bone owns the STR- bone before it, which results in some funkyness. This should only be relevant for Phileas, since his head rig is a separate rig element.

    May 4:
        - Set up metarig for Pip 
        - Investigate Grease Pencil rigging... it's not very good. It's really bad actually, so I made a curve-based replica of the mouth. Not sure about the eyes yet, but will probably have a similar fate.
        CloudRig:
            - Fix the same bug on stretch constraints as yesterday, but better
            - Fix a bug on curve rigs where they would miss some controls when cyclic==False.
            - IK snapping now uses tail distance (simple maths) instead of rotation difference(complicated maths) to determine which way to put the IK pole. This fixes the snapping issues seen on Gabby and Lunte, but still isn't perfect.
            - Fix IK pole control having weird rotation (visual issue only)

    May 5: Dutch Liberation Day

    May 6:
        - Started implementing bone group and bone layer parameters, so they can be customized on each rig element. Not usable yet, but the UI is there and I think it will work out nicely.
        - Cleaned up cloudrig.py before Sybren tears it apart on the livestream.
        - Made short video on Gabby rigging process for the supercut video.

    May 7:
        - Realizing that a lot of people are trying to learn from cloudrig.py, I added and clarified a ton more comments and renamed some variables to make it as easy to learn from as possible.
        - Posted rig walkthrough video
        - Made eye curves for Pip, still no weights though.
        - Massive progress on the Bone Group system on CloudRig. Now each rig element can assign its set of bones to any arbitrary bone group and assign them to any arbitrary set of layers. It can still be improved by adding rig-wide overrides for certain bone sets, and implementing a customizable bone layer UI. But for now, I can finally move face/hair/finger/clothes related bones to the layers they belong, 100% of the time.
        - Did some tweaks on Phileas that were requested by Pablo and Simon. Also applied the new bone layer tech to his metarig, so all his bones are now nicely organized.

    May 8:
        - Improve reliability of curve rig generation in CloudRig, and better error reporting for when it fails.
        - Finish rigging Pip, including a new mouth shape, all the weight painting, modifiers and drivers. Still some discussion to be had on how to handle the eyes, but I want to wait until he gets some testing.

    May 11:
        - Lots of troubleshooting on Phileas.
        - Trying to hunt down why the boolean modifier on Phileas's mouth is behaving erratically. Managed to get it to break a lot less often with Simon's help.
        - Some changes for Pip requested by Hjalti.

    May 12: Took a day off.

    May 13:
        - Fix some bone layer assingment issues on Phileas.
        CloudRig:
        - Bone layers no longer use ugly magic numbers.
        - Started implementing customizable Layers UI.

    May 14:
        - Various small fixes on Pip for Hjalti
        CloudRig:
        - Fully implemented customizable rig layer UI!!!
        - Implement layer assignment override for Deform/Mechanism/Org bone sets.
        - Pre-made MetaRigs (eg. Cloud_Human) are now appended from a .blend file rather than having to be encoded into a generation code, and then re-generated from that code.

        - Move Widget management code to the Generator code, and improve it such that a Widgets collection is always created if it isn't found, is always hidden, and is named after the rig.
        - Moved root control layer assignment parameters into the Generator code.
        - Moved CloudRig generator parameters into a PropertyGroup to avoid cluttering python api
        - Moved Bone Sets parametergroup from the top to the bottom of parameter UI, to better indicate that the available layer assignments are affected by the preceeding parameters.

        - Active and protected rig layers are now copied from the metarig
        - Armature display modes are now copied from the metarig
        - Clean up various hackarounds that are no longer needed

        - Update Gabby with the new features. Phileas also almost done.

    May 15:
        - Fixed the tiniest of Blender bugs :) D7744
        - Did a lot of refactoring in bone.py to make the code a lot more readable and sensible. Inspired by Sybren :)
        - Fix a backwards compatibility issue with existing animations on Gabby
        - Finish updating Phileas with latest CloudRig features. Also did Lunte but running into some issues...

    May 18:
        - Fix scale inheritance issue that I ran into while trying to update Lunte to latest CloudRig. Problem also existed on other characters, so updated those again too.
        - Made it easier to parent things to bendy bones(which should be done with Armature constraints, which need to be at the top of the constraint stack)
        - Fix Layers UI relying on Rigify addon to be enabled
        - Minor fixes on Pip's hair for Hjaltin
        - Crossed off some TODO's in cloud_limbs.
        - Experimented with a bone group selection color feature where instead of toggling between having all bone groups use the same selected/active color, we have a blend factor, but it turned out pretty useless/bad so I just nuked the whole thing.
        - Finally figured out how to prevent rig_ui.py from being created... it was... stupidly simple.
        - Planned out some documentation, a potential eye tracking rig, and the outline of some videos I want to make for the cloud.

    May 19:
        - Some changes and fixes on Pip for Simon
        - Made most of a video about how I set up Pip's metarig. Editing with Blender is so painful, I've vowed to never do it again.

    May 20:
        - Fix a double parenting issue on Gabby
        - Submitted a fix for Rigify (D7801)
        CloudRig:
        - Added support for vector customproperties being displayed in the rig UI.
        - Started a Wiki on the github page.
        - Wrote in-depth documentation on the bone organization system https://github.com/Mets3D/CloudRig/wiki/Organizing-Bones
        - Wrote in-depth documentation on the custom property system https://github.com/Mets3D/CloudRig/wiki/Custom-Properties

    May 21: Ascension Day (holiday)

    May 22:
        - Finish Pip metarig video
        - Implement prop_hierarchy so custom properties can be hierarchical. Need to write documentation.

    May 25:
        - Posted Pip metarig video https://cloud.blender.org/p/settlers/5ecb83e1d2d0a4657a7637df
        - Implement Create Root Bone generator parameter, so rigs can be generated without a root bone.
        - Fix some Armature constraints not working when they should...
        - Spent some time learning about GitLab and migrating CloudRig to it. Realized I have some unpushed changes on my home PC, so I'll get those merged first and then start committing on GitLab. Will have to shuffle the ReadMe around a bit.
        - Wrote in-depth documentation on each rig type 
        - Was trying to get said documentation to be accessible from within Blender. Failed, and ended up working on a patch for that. (D7837)
        - Started rigging Pip car.

    May 26:
        - Finish migration to GitLab.
        - Finished rigging Pip car and van.
        CloudRig:
            Start major refactoring efforts to reduce the areas where I'm re-implementing Rigify functions. 
            This does require hacking around Rigify limitations, 
            which were the reason I re-implemented stuff my way in the first place, 
            but my hope is that one day I will make patches to fix these things upstream.

            - Refactored constraint management so I can now call Rigify's make_constraint() function to create my constraint.
            - Constraint data is now saved in its own class. Hopefully this won't get as bloated as the BoneInfo class.

            - Got rid of all use cases of utils.copy_attributes() which was a messy piece of recursive clusterfuck. Deleted utils.py.
            - Delete settlers_mouth rig as I never ended up using it, and it was pretty pointless.

            - Started refactoring drivers, not so happy with the results so far. Also Rigify won't let me create variables that target a datablock type other than Object. Yet another thing to fix upstream.

    May 27:
        - Finish refactoring drivers.
        - Added color properties to Pip for Simon to hook up to the shaders.
        - Pip: Fix scale propagation issue on face and wrong thickness of mouth.
        - Refactor how I manage custom properties to something a lot more sane. This could be upstreamed to Rigify also.

    May 28:
        - Tested D7855
        - Fully refactored BoneGroup, BoneInfoContainer and BoneGroupContainer into one superior BoneSet class.
        - Deleted bone_group.py, id.py as they were no longer needed.
        - Basically same deal as previous refactoring efforts. The code structure is really starting to make a lot more sense now.
        Need to fix a bug with root bone scale tho...

    May 29:
        - Celebrate CoffeeRun premiere, be on livestream
        - Fix some toe drivers that got flipped during refactor
        - Fix root bone shape scale exploding
        - Curve rigs UI fixes and code cleanup

June
    June 2:
        - Fix another issue with Pip's toe.
        - Fix Rigify Buttons panel in edit mode was not working.
        - Fix regular Rigify types throwing error with CloudRig generator. Although full compatibility with regular Rigify is not really a goal, it should at least manage to generate.
        - Fix IK/FK switching not working on the spine
        - Moved a bunch of functionality that belonged in the FK chain code, into the FK chain code.

    June 3:
        - Fix some issues on Rain for Pablo.
        Took 3/4 of the day off due to eye pain. It continued at home, even after several hours of taking the lense out. Strange.

    June 4:
        - Some cleanup on Pip so Simon can do a V1 release.
        - Improve mouth weights on Rain for Pablo.
        - CloudRig:
            - Fix rigify compatibility mode always being enabled instead of only when needed.
            - Fix cloud_spline_ik not working in some cases, and not updating the generated curve in other cases.
            - Finish documentation of custom properties and curve rig types.

    June 5: Day off due to eye pain.

    June 8:
        - Script, record, edit first 6 minutes of weight painting tutorial

    June 9:
        - Script, record, edit another 3 minutes of weight painting tutorial. Showed it to a friend for feedback, found some audio balance issues. Considering cutting into multiple parts soon.
        - Some troubleshooting for Pablo.
        - Some discussions on a Rigify patch with Ivan Cappiello and Alexander Gavrilov.

    June 10:
        - Fix an error on Pip/CloudRig for Hjalti.
        - Figure out how to fix audio and render from Resolve, and rendered first version of the first part of the weight painting tutorial. At this pace it looks like it could be a 3-4 parter.
        - Got my first fix committed for Rigify. Have ideas for a lot more, but will have to see what time allows.

    June 11:
        - Split off the weight painting tools from MetsTools into a new EasyWeight addon on gitlab.
        - Started looking at what I could contribute to Rigify.
            In doing so I realized it could really use unit tests.
            I started learning about unit tests with some guidance from Sybren.
            Managed to get baby's first unit test working, detecting missing bones in the generated rig. Woohoo!

    June 12:
        - Worked more on Rigify rig generation unit testing.
        - Changes in bone properties, constraints, bone custom properties are detected.
        - Changes in drivers of bone properties and constraint properties are detected.
        This more or less covers everything, so next time I will start actually working on a Rigify commit and use this test to make sure I don't break anything.
        In future I can also use this for testing CloudRig refactors, which would've been very helpful some time ago.

        - Set up both upstairs and downstairs recording rooms so I don't have to do it at home.


    June 15:
        - Scripted and recorded audio for weight painting tutorial part 2.
        - Made D8041

    June 16
        - Tested D7499
        Rain:
            - Updated her to latest cloudrig functionality.
            - Viewport Display panel works again... /wrists
            - Reimplemented old "Enable Modifiers" button as a shiny new Quality slider.
            - Troubleshooting mask modifier performance drop for Pablo, it turned out to be this old problem T68740.
            - Added python app handler workaround, should have good performance while masks are turned on now.
        - Got final cut of audio for weight painting tutorial part 2, just need video.

    June 17:
        - Got final cut of video for weight painting tutorial part 3.

    June 18:
        - Half a day off due to eye appointment.
        Rain:
            - Add parent switcher for eye target.
            - Turn face-settings into a cloudrig-compatible dictionary stored in the armature custom properties.
            - Update cloudrig.py accordingly, removing the final pieces of hardcoding it used to have for Rain!
        - More testing and feedback on D7499.
        - Made D8070.

    June 19:
        - More D7499 constraint UI rework feedback.
        CloudRig:
            - BoneInfo class now handles pose bone and data bone property drivers separately.
            - BBone drivers now go on data bone properties instead of pose bone properties, leaving more control for animators (inspired by what for a minute I thought was a bug in Rigify).
            - Sharp Sections parameter now affects the driver expression instead of the property value.
        - Investigated an issue in Rigify where the console is spammed with errors when using Legacy mode and changing rig type options, but fixing it seems like it would be a big undertaking. Despite the error spam, everything works correctly, so I guess it's not a big problem, just a shame.
        - Made D8077.
        - Started working on a patch to improve UX when adding or editing custom properties. Will finish in my free time as it's not strongly enough related to my work.

    June 22:
        - Got started planning and implementing a new rig type for CloudRig, CloudBBoneGrid.
            Rain's face mostly consisted of what I can only describe as a BBone Grid, 
            so the goal with this is to generate something like that. 
            The issue is, the customization this needs on a per-character basis is quite low level, 
            so might have to come up with some new system or convention to allow 
            per-bone customization of rig behaviour in the metarig, 
            without requiring so much manual input that it would defeat the purpose of rig generation.
        - Scripted and recorded audio for part 3 of the weight painting tutorial.
            Would love to edit it at the same time as well, but Resolve won't open on the recording PC and troubleshooting on Linux is... awful.

    June 23: Took a day off.

    June 24:
        - Found a Rigify bug report (T78193), looked into it a bit.
        - Found another Rigify bug report (T78217) and looked into it.
        - Submitted D8102. (Not related to either)
        - Went back to part 2 of the weight painting thing and did some re-recording for some parts I didn't like.
        - Learned how to make Blender VSE less awful with help from Sebastian. Might try using it again. Will regret.

    June 25:
        - Blender started bugging out after some editing, so after wasting some time troubleshooting it I gave up.
        - Tried Olive again, but after wasting some time looking for better ways to do retiming I gave up.
        - Back to Davinci with most of the day gone, I recorded a correction for the audio and got started on the video but couldn't finish.

    June 26:
        - Finished part 3 of the weight painting tutorial disaster... It took the entire week, but at least it wasn't worth it.
        - Helped Pablo with an issue on Rain's face.
        - Looked into making IK->FK snapping more reliable, got something that might work, and committed it on Rain.

    June 29:
        - Cleaned up the Barber for Pablo so he can start working when he's ready.
        - Made some changes to our branch of BlenRig for the same reason.
        - Investigated T78193 more thoroughly, decided to call in the big guns, Alexander provided a patch that covers the issue very nicely.
        - Worked on some patches after hours. (D8041, D6100, D8154)
            - Put up with Juan Pablo's thick skull, this guy is an actual lemon.

    June 30:
        - Birthday!
        - Worked on getting CloudRig up to date with some recent Rigify updates.
        - Started implementing a versioning system for CloudRig so I can be more free with changing things and trying to not break backwards compatibility as much.
        - Right Click->Online Manual on CloudRig operators and properties now links to appropriate wiki pages.

July
    July 1:
        - Blender presentation by Ton & HR
        - Had a SUPER interesting and useful hour long video chat with Ivan Cappiello about the procedural face rigging they used at MAD. 
            He also gave me some code and sample blend file to play around with.
            Super nice guy!
        - CloudRig: Cleanup work to improve some stuff in prep for eye rig implementation

    July 2:
        - Helped Andy fix up Pablo's old breakdance animation, got it functioning again.
        - Spent some time researching horses to help out with a Rigify horse skeleton dilemma. 
            It also relates to general quadruped rigging, and we talked about implementing a rear paw rig which Pablo mentioned before I should do so CloudRig can work on quadrupeds.
        - Investigated why Pablo can't customize his selection sets on a library overridden rig... ran into what I guess is just an unfinished part of library overrides? T78534
        - Added some bones to the barber

    July 3:
        - Implemented the most complex parts of the cloud_eye rig type. Still need to add some basic things though.

    July 6:
        - Finished the cloud_eye rig type, am pretty happy with it.
        Got started on modifications for the cloud_chain rig to add some functionality to it that will make it more useful for rigging the face.
            The details here are not crystal clear and it may take a bit of trial and error in terms of what functionality do I actually want, but I have ideas.
        - cloud_chain chains will now have a smoother curvature. I haven't thought of a use case for when this is not desired, so it's not an option to turn this back off. It wasn't needed before since the rig was only used for limbs, which were straight lines where it didn't matter.

    July 7:
        - cloud_chain will now have a consistent density of bbone segments, rather than the same number of BBone segments on every deform bone.
        - Overhauled all rig types' UI to single column layout and cleaned up some code.
        - Had to fix some stuff with the smooth curvature thing I did yesterday.
        - Added a new parameter to rig parameter copying operator so it can optionally only copy rig parameters into selected bones of the same rig type.
        Tomorrow plan: implement cloud_glue rig type.

    July 8:
        - Made a cloud_template rig type for copy pasting when implementing new types, and as a learning resource in case someone wanted to make their own rig types based on CloudRig.
        - Made a cloud_face_chain rig type that extends cloud_chain with functionality that allows these rigs to interact with each other.

    July 9:
        - cloud_face_chain: Chain controls can now merge together when they intersect with other ones
            We can also relink constraints from ORG bones to control bones

    July 10:
        - Help Bastien with testing a library overrides patch which is vital so we can get Pablo back to testing library overrides.
            (D8249, D8250)
        - Finish the two main face chain features from yesterday:
            - Chains can now merge controls when intersecting within the same rig
            - Constraints can be relinked to the control at the tail of the chain by prefixing the constraint name with "TAIL".
        - Made a small proposal (T78794)
        - Found a crash (T78796)
        - Chain bones' bbone_segments parameter was replaced with bbone_density, and can now do a consistent density of bbone segments.

    July 13:
        - Looked into a crash relating to Rigify that is (and has been) preventing me from adding PointerProperties to CloudRig, forcing me to use shitty StringProperties instead. Couldn't figure out exactly what's causing it myself, but poked AlexanderGavrilov about it with my best guess.
        - Tried thinking about how Rigify could better dynamically register property definitions... but every solution has some pretty major downsides.

    July 14:
        - The crash I burned all of yesterday on seems like it may have been caused by mode switching, which AnGavrilov let me know can be avoided via a new PyAPI function vertex_indices_set().
            I still crashed once after implementing the fix but I couldn't get it to crash anymore, so HMMM...
            Still, I stuck to it, and I started using PointerProperties in various places, improving UX, as long as it doesn't crash.
        - Started implementing the Action Set-up system.
            For Rain, this used to be an operator that automatically set up action constraints.
            For CloudRig this will be something similar, except instead of an operator it is a list of the data structures that will be used to set up the constraints.
            That list's UI is mostly done, nice and foolproof, although I'm not too sure on where the whole thing lives atm.

    July 15:
        - Initial functionality for the Action Set-up system. Just needs to support symmetry, and for that I need to take care of some other stuff first.
        - Improved naming for merging controls between different cloud_face_chains, 
            so eg. a bone is now named "STR-I-Nostrils1" instead of "STR-I-Nostrils1+Nostrils1.L.R", or 
            "STR-I-Lip_Top1+Bot1.L" instead of "STR-I-Lip_Top1+Lip_Bot1.L", etc. Ie, the naming for these combined controls is now a lot more compact while still making sense.

    July 16:
        - Merged controls created by cloud_face_chain that have an X head coordinate of 0 will have their orientation set to be world-aligned.
        - Implemented symmetry for action set-up, as all the prerequisites for it are now done.
        - Re-wrote the entirety of the cloud_chain rig type. It was the very first rig that got implemented, so at the time I didn't really have the code structure that I wanted figured out yet. Should be a lot cleaner now.
        - Added a new feature to cloud_chain: Smooth Splines. This is how Rain's face behaved also, except it can be a lot simpler now thanks to some constraint improvements since then by AnGavrilov.

    July 20:
        Started reorganizing my currently terribly organized code. 
            Thankfully I organize all my terribly organized code into a couple "utils" files - these need to be split up into smaller, more focused files with a descriptive name.
        - Consolidated all naming related functionality into utils/naming.py
        - Consolidated all object related functionality into utils/object.py
        - Consolidated all math related functionality into utils/maths.py

    July 21:
        - Improve code structure of naming utilities. I originally wanted to use multiple-inheritance but that turned out very messy.
        - Cross out a lot of TODO's.... and find some new ones.

    July 22:
        - Fixed all remaining TODO's that were marked IMPORTANT.
        - Got started on an eyelid setup system. I could do this in the metarig, so I didn't do it before because it didn't seem vital... But on second thought, I think some parts of this can be kept procedural, so it's probably worth a shot.

    July 23:
        - Implemented the eyelid thing for the most part, but kind of a crap day for my brain. Felt like I was functioning at a solid 20% capacity. Very slow day, quite sad.

    July 24:
        - The issue that I was stumped on for like 3 hours yesterday I fixed in 10 minutes... it was very simple... brain power was definitely at a low point yesterday.

    July 27:
        - Helped Pablo get up and running again (had to fiddle with his BlenRig installation and bringing over 2.90 userprefs)
        - Submitted https://developer.blender.org/D8403 so Pablo can use selection sets.
        CloudRig:
            - Eye rig's sticky eyelids feature now tapers off towards the edges of the eyelids. It should work regardless of eye orientation and eye size. Hopefully.

    July 28:
        - Some updates to documentation.
        - Override troubleshooting for Pablo.
        - Got some feedback on CloudRig from Ivan Cappiello, some bugs, some suggestions, worked on those.

    July 29:
        - Final updates to the documentation.
        - Added the Sintel metarig to CloudRig to showcase the Actions system.
        - D8422
        - Made two versions of a Snow character rig for Sebastian to test the soft body GSoC thing.

    July 30:
        - Split up cloud_eye rig into a simpler cloud_aim rig. cloud_eye now just extends that and adds the eyelid functionality.
        - Troubleshoot some weirdness for Pablo
        - Attempt to implement Bone Sets as a UIList and figure out why it is kind of impossible.
        - Added basic support for Selection Sets.

    July 31:
        - Fix Rigify elements failing to generate with CloudRig elements (reported by Ivan Cappiello)
        - Update docs for cloud_eye and cloud_aim.
        - Make a quick test on Emily to see how troublesome the thin neck would be.

August
    August 3
        - Implement cyclic functionality for cloud_chain.
        - Started refactoring cloud_spine so that it is no longer responsible for the neck and the head, and inherits from cloud_fk_chain rather than cloud_chain. Still WIP.

    August 4
        - Wrote a script for Pablo to time remap his animation because it was accidently on 30 fps and they want it to be on 24.
        - Finished refactoring cloud_spine.
            - Support multiple spines within a single rig.
            - Support arbitrary length spine rig (worked before but badly)
            - Slightly better behaviour for hip and torso controls (affect the center of the spine a bit more)

    August 5
        - Slapped a simple rig on the Sprite.
        - Lots of easy code refactoring. (I left the easy stuff last, for some reason)
        - Wrote some notes on how one could fork or contribute to CloudRig
            - Includes some coding conventions which I wasn't really adhering to before but now I am.
            - Includes some thoughts on what CloudRig features might be a good idea to upstream into Rigify. 
            A lot of the stuff is inter-dependent though, so it needs some thought put into it, but I have an idea on where I could start.

    August 6
        - Worked on versioning code so that Lunte's now outdated metarig is automatically updated with the correct new rig types and parameters on file load.
            (I don't actually care about Lunte's metarig working, but this is a test to see what I can and can't do by versioning, since it informs what kind of changes will be backwards-compatibility breaking in the future)
            Result was satisfactory, although some things still needed to be tweaked manually.
        - Ran into a number of bugs while testing Lunte. Luckily so, because they would've caused a mess if Pablo started animating the sprite before they got fixed, because the naming and numbering of bones was wrong.

    August 7
        - Implemented a proper way for rigs to disable their inherited parameters. For example, the cloud_spine rig inherits the deform_segments parameter from cloud_chain, but it should always be 1. 
        Previously, forcing it to 1 and graying it out required putting code all over the place. Now it's just one line at the top of the class, and it's all handled by code in cloud_base.
        This did require having to use wrapper functions for UILayout.prop() and prop_search(), but I'm okay with that.
        - D8496: Rigify: Implement T78463: better support unguligrade animals (horse) setup

    August 10
        - D8514: Rigify: Code tweaks
        - D8519: Rigify: Addon Prefs & Feature Sets UI
        - D8524: Rigify: Add manual mapping

    August 11
        - Rigged Emily and played around with physics a lot. 
        The results are okay but only when scaled up 10x, which is not great.

    August 12
        - Started implementing my Make Physics Bone Chain operator from many years ago as a rig type. Halfway there.

    August 13:
        - Finished implementing cloud_physics_chain rig, added documentation.
        - Implement new Preserve Volume parameter on cloud_chain rig so Pablo can have true squash and stretch where he needs it.
        - Some bugfixes on cloud_spine and widget collection code

    August 14:
        - Fixes and improvements on the physics rig
        - Begging people to look at my patches
        - Scaled the Sprite rig while unbreaking pablo's animations, as it was originally 20 meters tall

    August 17:
        - Pipeline discussions with Simon and a little bit with Sybren
        - Gave another attempt to BoneSet UIList idea, this time given up on it permanently and deleted the file.
        - Majorish cleanup in bone.py to make BoneSets and BoneInfos easier and less confusing to create.

    August 18:
        - Finish BoneInfo refactor from yesterday
        - Start cleaning up pipeline script, turning it into a proper addon, testing.
        - Update my Rigify patch D8519 based on feedback from Ivan & Alexander.

    August 19:
        - Another update to D8519 and some failed experiments for allowing feature sets to register their own preferences.
        - Generator now keeps track of all BoneInfo and BoneSet instances of all rigs
        - CloudBaseRig class no longer does any special thing with BoneInfo and BoneSets.
        My hope is that this will make it easier to potentially upstream these features in Rigify, but I have no timeline on that...
        Even my current tiny patches are taking an absolute eternity to get reviewed.

    August 20:
        - Work on Pipeline script.

    August 21:
        - More work on Pipeline script.

    August 24:
        - Fix icky error in CloudRig that's been making it totally broken for 5 days, oops.
        - Override crash bug hunt T80078
        - Updated Rigify patch D8496 with feedback from Ivan Cappiello.
        - Got started on an automatic rubber hose limb feature for cloud_limbs rig.

    August 25:
        - Finished Auto Rubber Hose feature.
        - Two more rounds of feedback on D8496. Hopefully that's it.
        - Fix some new scale propagation issues in CloudRig, cause it's been a while, and that shit never stays unbroken for too long.
        - Fix some other bugs I found some time ago.
        - Spent some time thinking about a keyframe baking addon for a specific use case that Pablo asked for. Might work on it tomorrow. I'm not sure if it should be part of CloudRig or not.

    August 26:
        - Trying to untangle keyframe baking code that already exists in Rigify and seems to work well, but is a bit complex.
        - Got parent switching with keyframe baking to work but it is dodgy and very basic for now.

    August 27:
        - More fiddling and headache with the Rigify keyframe baking code. 
        I can't decide whether it's good code or bad, but I think at least now 
        I know which parts of it I want to use and how... still, not sure if 
        I'll get it working by tomorrow.

    August 28:
        - Parent switching and hinge toggle keyframe baking now work, IK/FK switch is still TODO.

    August 31:
        - Fix the more glaring issues on Emily, but don't want to spend too much time on rigging a sculpt mesh it so it's still terrible all around.
        - Fix some IK/FK snapping and parent switching related bugs
        - Do some testing on overrides.

September
    Sept 1:
        - Finish IK/FK snapping and baking
        - Got some notes from Pablo for some general rig improvement ideas, got started on those
    
    Sept 2:
        - Finished addressing Pablo feedback, he also found some bugs with IK/FK snapping (not surprised) that I fixed.
        - Did some pipeline testing with Phil, found some errors, fixed em.
        - Made metarig for Phil.
    
    Sept 3:
        - Did some weight painting for Phil so he can be animated more or less properly.
        - Did some experimenting with detachable limbs for the sprite.
    Sept 4:
        - Add an operator to flatten IK chains for easier metarig authoring.
        - Take part in Code Quality Day, got some Rigify code cleanup in with help from Sybren: D8514, D8801

    Sept 7:
        - Fix baking keyframe range not working.
        - Keyframe baking logic is now part of cloudrig.py, no longer requires CloudRig being installed.
        - Finish code cleanup patches from Friday: D8802, D8804
        - Refactor cloud_eye into cloud_eyelid - same logic, but the correct way around. This should be more intuitive and requires fiddling with less settings, just need to update documentation.
    Sept 8:
        - Learned a bit about hair in Blender
        - Checked out the soft body GSOC branch, looks fairly promising, UX could be better and there is some jittering.

    Sept 9:
        - Some Overrides and other troubleshooting for Pablo, apparently his Blender was stuck on July 30.
        - Tortured Julian Eisel by watching him work on D8846 for me for an hour, to print object names in the console for modifier errors, which will save me a lot of time.
        - Rigged a Sprite hat
        - Found a major bug/limitation in cloud_face_chain and tried to tackle it but failed... will get back to this when I'm back on Monday.
        - More playing around with GSOC soft body.

    Sept 10: Day off (Mom wedding)
    Sept 11: Day off

    Sept 14:
        - Put a temp-rig on Ellie sculpt
        - Fixed a CloudRig bug resulting in a dependency cycle on leg rigs

    Sept 15:
        - Experimenting with https://developer.blender.org/D7437, I think I might be able to use it to greatly improve my face rig tech.
    
    Sept 16:
        - More experimenting and success! Started implementing it in CloudRig with optimism that the patch will make it to master soon.
        I don't think implementing it will be simple because there are a lot of weird cases to cover.
    
    Sept 17:
        - Managed to re-implement cloud_face_chain with the Custom Space feature, seems to be fully working.
    
    Sept 18:
        - It was NOT fully working. Spent the entire day re-thinking my solution, and after staying in till 23:30 
        with help from Simon, now it seems to be fully working... until further notice.
    
    Sept 21:
        - Worked on some Pablo requests:
            - Keyframe All Properties operator
            - Fix a snapping bug (was already fixed, had to commit)
            - Ask Bastien about latest news on Overrides, and whether the Animation Layers addon could work anytime soon. (no)
        - Slapped together and committed D8971
        - Tested some stuff for AnGavrilov https://developer.blender.org/rBS71b595fc0e6e592dad741c262e00c43298a55f46
    
    Sept 22:
        - Rigged Jay again.
        - Made T81059 after finally being able to reproduce this override crash on Pablo's PC.
        - CloudRig bug fixing
    
    Sept 23:
        - Experimented and found great success with overlay drawing for CloudRig. 
        It is a super fun feature to develop and to use, but it doesn't actually add any functionality and takes a lot of time to implement.
        It's just something I can work on when I have nothing better to do.

        Although it's possible that I could find animator-facing use cases, such as a proper Bone Picker, if anyone ever asks for that.

        - Rigged Rex for first time.
    
    Sept 24:
        - More hunting down this same crash for Bastien T81059
        - Round of feedback on Rex for Pablo
        CloudRig:
            - Fix an error
            - Add bone parenting logic for properly parenting things to chain rigs.
            - Experimented a bit with Gizmos. Super fun, and makes CloudRig fun to use. But it's a lot of time investment for something not that useful. Might work on it if I feel I can spare the time.
        
    Sept 25:
        CloudRig:
            - Improve IK control and FootRoll control placement so it's not always flattened against the world floor
            - Big refactor on cloud_limbs. It's now called cloud_limb and only contains the code for arms. Leg code is now split off into cloud_leg which inherits from cloud_limb.
            - Fix metarig versioning so the above changes are automatically applied to older metarigs.
        - Helped Bastien test a fix for the crash. It seems to have worked.
        - Experimented with and did some cleanup on the ShapeView addon that someone threw into the #blender-riggers chat this morning.
        https://github.com/joeedh/ShapeView
        This idea hasn't even occurred to me before and I think it could be REALLY interesting, for Sprites specifically. 
        The code is functional, just full of prints and the UI is a mess.
        Forked it: https://gitlab.com/blender/shapeview

    Sept 28:
        - Rigged new Phil.
        - Started working on automated generation of deformation test animations. Got an initial thing working but it needs some smartness put into it.
        - Wasted some time on figuring out curve background colors
    
    Sept 29:
        - First day of quarantine, pretty unproductive
        - Updated repos again, set up the new blender dropbox
        - Some work on making test animation generation better...
    
    Sept 30:
        - More work on test animation generation. It's a bit more headache to make it good than I'd hoped.
        - Some Phil troubleshooting for Pablo
    
October
    Oct 1:
        - Some more Phil fixes for Pablo
        
        CloudRig:
        Finally landed on a code and UI design for animation generation that feels like a fair middle ground between usability, UI clutter and clean code.
            - Test animation generation is now handled by the generator. This is great so we don't have to rely on rig execution order, which is counter-productive to usability in this case (Fingers should animate after the arm, not after the leg).
            - Exposed (for now only) three parameters on FK chains and its extensions:
                - Whether to generate a test animation for this rig at all (Some chains like hair or clothes might want to be excluded from testing)
                - Minimum and maximum rotation angles to test (Most rigs need their own numbers, so this is changed often)
                - Which rotation axes to test (Fingers really only need to test for one rotation axis)
                The first option is only available when the generator's Generate Test Action parameter is enabled, and the other two options are only available when the first option is enabled.
                This is intended as a pretty advanced feature, so I don't mind if it's hard to find.
            This still can still be improved; Limb rigs currently test the elbow joints way harder than need be, but ohwell.
            Also needs some documentation and the correct setup to be included in the metarigs. I will do this after more testing when I'm sure I want to keep the current design.

        Made D9081.
        Made D9082.

        D9094
        D9096

    Oct 5:
        CloudRig:
            - Update/fix rig samples/metarigs
            - Testing and error fixing on the animation generation and general rig generation.
        
        - Some work on character pipeline addon
        - (somewhat) Prepared a metarig for Victoria for when Julien has time to clean up her mesh
        - Tested a super secret beta of a Picker add-on... It... sort of mostly functions. But for something whose sole purpose is convenience, it needs a lot of work still.

    Oct 6:
        - Make CloudRig Flatten Chain operator more betterer. TODO: More IK related things need to be less picky about bone axis angles.
        - Helped Simon investigate some issues with Jay and Rex's eyeballs exploding using the pipeline addon.
        - Rigged Victoria. Usable but very rough and no face yet.
    
    Oct 7:
        - Fix some bugs with CloudRig face chain
        - Rigged Victoria's face to some extent:
            - only high level control for now is upper eyelid, rest are low-level
            - as always, all automatic weights (will probably stay that way until final topo)

    Oct 8:
        - More Victoria face rigging. Calling it finished for now. Can move both eyelids, mouth corners and open her mouth.
        - cloud_face_chain intersection controls' rotation propagates to STR controls again (needs Custom Space patch to be better! ^^)
        - Used my brain waves to concieve a warning/logging/troubleshooting system for CloudRig. Want to ditch the terminal especially for user-facing warnings. Wrote some of the boilerplate.

    Oct 9:
        - Rigged Victoria's hair with Sergey's tech
        - Implemented the warning/logging/troubleshooting system with all of the features based on the design I came up with yesterday. Am very happy. Just need to use it in more places.

    Oct 12:
        - Started working on Rex face, not done yet
        - Get Rex to work with the pipeline
        Some assistance for Pablo:
        - Fix some things and performance on Victoria
        - Quick fix a crash after Resync, if it comes up again I'll poke Bastien
        - Fix a bug with the sprite's mushroom hat
        CloudRig:
        - Add a stack trace to CloudRig log entries.

    Oct 13:
        - Spent the morning troubleshooting some override breakage for Pablo (reported a crash for Bastien)
            + a quick Jay pipeline-compatibility fix
        - Fix some issues on Victoria face
        - More work on Rex face. Deform and STR layer are done, just needs weights and actions.

    Oct 14:
        - Finish Rex face rig

    Oct 15:
        - Fix some things on Rex
        - Added Bug Report feature in CloudRig (part of troubleshooting features - if a log entry is considered a bug, it will show a Report Bug operator.)
        - Set up Ellie for the pipeline and set up metarig for the body.
        - Went on Animation module meeting to kick devs

    Oct 16:
        - Set up Blender building.
        - Tried to hunt down a bug/feature that is not letting me work on Ellie because weight painting is going full potato. T81745
        - Re-made Rex anim/pose files with latest master to get super stable overrides (<3 Bastien)
        - Started rigging the latest version of Ellie. Face is TODO.
    
    Oct 19:
        - Update Ellie rig with latest face and hair changes
        - Finished Ellie face rig deformation layer (it deforms but still needs some work to be usable)
    
    Oct 20:
        - Fix stuff on Ellie
        - Hunt down my weight painting issue D9287
        - Improve fingers on Sprite
    
    Oct 21:
        - Rex tech experimentation with Shrinkwrap (not exactly what I meant to do this week but relevant)

    Oct 22:
        - Some fire extinguishing for the cover blend file pipeline compatibility
        - More Rex tech experimentation with Shrinkwrap
        - Fix all four current sources of console warning spam during rig generation.
        - Start work on Corrective Actions: Action set-ups now use new Eval Timer feature, whose value I will be able to use to activate corrective actions. 
            Still need a design on how to communicate to the metarig that an action set-up should be a corrective one, and what parameters that needs.
        
    Oct 23:
        - Finish implementing Corrective Actions, after lots of headache.
    
    Oct 26:
        - Write 7 tips for 3D World.
    
    Oct 27:
        - Fix a pipeline addon issue for Simon
        - Work on automating one of the processes required for Shrinkwrap tech which will likely be used on all characters to preserve silhouettes.
        - Some brainstorming with Pablo on how the basic chain rig works and could be improved.
    
    Oct 28:
        CloudRig: 
        - Fix some generation errors
        - Fail more gracefully, don't cause a mess
        - Add some more automatic metarig troubleshooting
        - Fix console warning spam, we have a clean console again, for now.

    Oct 29:
        - Make video for Blender Conference
    
    Oct 30:
        - Implement initial functionality of Pablo's alternate rubberhose behaviour.
        - Blender Conference!
    
November
    Nov 2:
        - Helping out Rik with onboarding
        - Working on rubber hose tech for Pablo (Is usable but could maybe be better still)
        - Started writing description for Cloud assets but ran into a lack of formatting, poked the web department and will pick up later Markdown support arrives :)

    Nov 3:
        - Waste some time on stressing about the heating bill
        - Iterate on rigging of the Effect Plane for Pablo
        - Help out Rik with some Rain/Blender stuff
        - Waste some time on coming up with a complex solution for a thing Pablo requested, which is splitting the ankle toon controls in two. In the end I went with a simpler solution that works somewhat.

    Nov 4:
        - Set up more development stuff on my home Windows PC so I can commit (arcanist, PHP, SSH all that bs).
        Rigify:
        - D9082: Committed.
        - D9096: Committed.
        - D9092: Updated based on feedback from AnGavrilov, whom I poked but no response.
        - D9094: Added Sybren as reviewer due to lack of feedback from AnGavrilov.
        CloudRig:
        - Rework a bit of the parent switching logic to fix something for Pablo.
        Lattice Smear tech:
        - Got around to some initial UI and bare minimum functionality. Plan to dedicate the rest of the week to this so this is good enough progress.

    Nov 5:
        - Worked on Camera Lattice addon, is pretty usable.

    Nov 6:
        - Worked on Tweak Lattice addon, is pretty usable.

    Nov 9:
        - Improved Camera Lattice and Tweak Lattice addons and merged them into a single Lattice Magic addon.
        - Fixed some issues on Rex.

    Nov 10:
        - Fixed an issue in the pipeline addon.
        - Fixed some issues on Rex, Victoria and CloudRig in general.
        - Tested some patches for Alexander Gavrilov.
        - Wrote descriptions for all my Sprites files on the Cloud.

    Nov 11:
        - Updated D9094.
        - Tested D7437 and D9493.
        - Updated all characters' metarigs and rigs to latest CloudRig. (And started putting together a script for making all metarigs consistent)

    Nov 12:
        - Fixed some Rigify documentation rBM7367 rBM7368
        - Listened in on Animation Module meeting
        - Updated CloudRig documentation with some new features and gifs.
        - Discussions with Alexander on how to proceed on removing Legacy from Rigify, which would be a great code quality task.
        - Discussions with Alexander on his patch D9493.
        - Some override troubleshooting with Simon.

    Nov 13:
        CloudRig Refactoring day!
        - Split up cloud_bone into two new rig types: cloud_copy and cloud_tweak.
        - They both now use my abstracted bone system, which makes the code 400x cleaner than before, and lets me do more things like relink drivers.
        - Versioning code so old metarigs should be updated automagically.
        - BoneInfo objects are now only created in one way, in one place, and nowhere else.
        - In the hierarchy of Generator->Rig->Bone Set->BoneInfo, each element is now only aware of the container one above or below it, rather than madness such as BoneInfo being aware of its generator or generator keeping track of all bone sets.
        - Dropped support for creating BoneInfos outside of BoneSets, which I should've done a long time ago.
            Bone Sets can still be created arbitrarily, which is fine.
            Exposing and accessing bone sets could still be improved.
        - Got rid of the stupid new_bonei() functions, as it's now replaced by BoneSet.new() which makes a whole lot more sense.
        - Original bones can now be read into a BoneInfo instance including their constraints and drivers. Means they can be modified from there too.
            They can even be renamed, which was extremely satanic before, but not anymore. Only slightly now.
        - Use 3 dictionaries to read and write between BoneInfo and Blender bone types instead of repeating a bunch of properties
        - Get rid of silly `all_bones` property that was always just a lazy hack. Rigs shouldn't directly be aware of all their bones, only all their bone sets.
            If needed, this can come back as a @property, but only as that!
        - Some UI improvements:
            - Updated outdated Spine rig description
            - Fix text boxes missing the first line of every word... been like that for months, yikes.
            - Bone selector and a warning when Armature Constraint will be used for selecting parent bone for cloud_copy.

    Nov 16:
        - Made demo videos for the release to showcase overrides
        - Got started on Rex face

    Nov 17:
        - Rex face rigging

    Nov 18:
        - Attempted to implement some feedback on the spine rig and the teeth in a simple way. If that doesn't work out I'll have to try something more complex (ie. redesign and rebuild the spine rig) but that would take too long so I hope it won't be neccessary.
        - Worked on a script to keep all Sprites character rigs consistent. (To set a lot of settings on the metarig.)

    Nov 19:
        - Added Shrinkwrap tech to Rex's face. (as seen before)
        - Fixed some bugs relating to Shrinkwrap tech, and moving drivers from the metarig to the generated rig.
        - Worked a little bit on the mouth corner low level behaviour.

    Nov 20:
        - Restarted on Rex's face without bendy bones.

    Nov 23:
        - More rex face re-rigging

    Nov 24:
        - Deliver Rex face MVP with working mouth corner and jaw controls

    Nov 25
        - Made a Resync+Reload all Overridden collections operator for convenience, not too sure if it works yet.
        Updated all characters to latest CloudRig, address most animator feedback, clean up CloudRig warnings:
        Everyone:
            - New spine set-up
            - Move hip controls down by a lot
            - Bone layer organization and display size fixes
            - Adjust length ratios of upper/lower arm
        Rex:
            - Eye highlight follows the eyeball
            - Place tracking bones properly
            - Fix some weights on the chest
        Jay:
            - Add Hinge toggle for the chain
            - Add control to top of the hat
            - Hide hair that was clipping with the hat
        Victoria:
            - Fix tilt on foot bone display
        Phil:
            - Rename Belly control to Tummy because name clashing

    Nov 26:
        - Fix tooth parenting on Rex
        - Make a proxy sprite rig for Pablo
        - Rigged Rex eyelids (roughly).
    
    Nov 27:
        - Add dummy bones to all the characters
        - Add widget object troubleshooting to CloudRig
        Rex:
            - Implement an idea and feedback from Rik on Rex's jaw
            - Make the eyebrows separable
            - Rig the extra cartoon shapes finally
        LatticeMagic:
            - Fix error when generating camera lattice from pose mode
            - Fix breakage on Rex due to rig helper object getting latticed when it shouldn't
            - Add operators to zero all keyframes and insert keyframes on all shape key values
            - Update active shape key on frame change (with a toggle to turn this off)

    Nov 30:
        (Had a very long lunchbreak because I had to take care of some stuff, hence the very late finish)
        - Test Rex face in some of Julien's sculpted poses and note some issues and potential improvements
        - Fix an issue with the eye highlight but not committed yet
        - Get feedback from Rik on more Rex face things and some other stuff
        - Slapped 6 bones on a bbq grill for Hjalti
        Lattice addon:
            - Remove redundant and buggy Radius slider from the Falloff popup
            - Add a not buggy Radius slider above the Create Tweak Lattice button so it can be pre-filled
            - Add options to parent the created lattice setup to an object or bone. Currently parenting can't easily be changed after creation, could be added later.
            - Add options to add and remove objects from a tweak lattice
            - Added option to create tweak lattice at the selection's bounding box center instead of 3D cursor but I doubt its usefulness

December
    Dec 1:
        - Fix some floating objects and other issues on Rex, Phil & Victoria
        - Started making some CloudRig functionality more generic so it works on all rigs. Constraint and driver re-linking, arbitrary parenting and parent switching. Only halfway done though. :/

    Dec 2:
        - Bit of pipeline addon troubleshooting in the morning ^^
        - Finish implementing very generic arbitrary parenting! All that's left is to update all the metarigs with some new parameters. I can now tell the metarig to generate parent switching options from anything to anything! I think! (well, as long as it doesn't create a depcycle... :D)

    Dec 3:
        - Adjust Rex finger proportions
        - Test several patches for Angavrilov
        - Update metarig consistency script with the new features
        - Re-rig Rex's eyelids with bendy bones (again)

    Dec 4:
        - Some troubleshooting and updating on Phil&Ellie for Hjalti&Pablo
        - Some CloudRig bugfixes relating to the above
        - Rex eyelid improvements
        - Cloud posts and testing and feedback
    
    Dec 7:
        - Re-rigged lips with bendy bones.
        - Lip controls can now be rotated uniformally to get somewhat of a lip roll effect.
        - Controls for entire Upper and lower lip.
        - Some troubleshooting for Hjalti and weight paint chats with Sybren
        - Worked on some documentation for CloudRig actions for my own sanity so I remember what my features do
        - 6 tiny bug fixes
        - Current state of Rex can be committed if needed, but not much of the feedback has been addressed yet (since I started with the hard bits, like re-doing the lips completely)
