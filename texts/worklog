March
    Mar 16:
        - Set up my Blender user preferences, VSC workspaces, git repos, CoffeeRun SVN at home. RapidSVN crashes on checkout, so I'm trying an SVN extension for VSC for now. (Which might be more convenient, if it turns out to be good)
        - Building Blender from source was failing, so I fixed that... I forgot how god damn slow it is on Windows though, so I'm honestly better off downloading the nightlies.
        - Campbell prompted me to write a giant wall of text for improving the hotkey editor. I made sure he will have regrets. developer.blender.org/T68884#892054
        - Got access to Notion and looked through the pages that seemed important ðŸ™‚
        - Started writing some documentation/tutorial/readme type thing for CloudRigify.

    Mar 17:
        CoffeeRun:
        - Re-generated crowd, hailey and sunny rigs after a refactor that caused all Rigify parameters to reset to their defaults. This time, without making everything explode.
        - Fixed some deformation and clipping on Hailey's chest with the wedding dress.
        - Fixed an issue on the Drape rig where the ribbon wasn't inheriting rotation from the root.
        CloudRigify:
        - cloud_bone: Implement create_deform_bone parameter. (Was needed for the drape)
        - Human Metarig now saves bbone scale, object name and object data name correctly.
        - Human Metarig no longer uses Rigify components, such as raw_copy, and uses cloud_bone instead.
        - Human Metarig no longer contains an outfit properties bone, because that relied on custom properties to function, and Metarigs don't save custom properties atm.
        - Figured out how to ensure that CloudRigify can simply be downloaded from github as a .zip, and that .zip can be installed in Rigify as a featureset package.
        - Had to re-organize and clean up the repository a fair bit.
        - Worked a bit on the README. Tried adding images but it was quite clunky, so I added some gifs where needed, which I think work pretty well. Good thing I'm working from home cause I'm not sure how I would've done this without ShareX...! Might still need some help with Markdown to make it a bit prettier, but from what I googled, it might not be possible.

    Mar 18:
        CloudRigify:
        - Added rig samples to some rigs, ensuring they can be generated on their own. Rig samples are examples that can be spawned in edit mode in the Rigify UI.
        - Fixed a bug where limb rigs could not be generated without a spine rig.
        - Improvements to parent switching setup so it doesn't rely on assumptions about available parents.
        - Fixed a bug in cloud_bone where the ORG- bones weren't constrained to the control bones.
        - Fixed a bug in cloud_bone where DEF- bones weren't created.
        - Burned probably half the day hunting down this bs developer.blender.org/T74888
        CoffeeRun:
        - Rigged a book
        - Updated Hail to latest cloudrig.py so Pablico can use IK snapping. 

    Mar 19:
        CoffeeRun:
        - Tiny hailey fix for Julien, some prop copies for Hjalti, another small tweak on the drape rig for Pablo.
        - While testing some rig generation stuff I tweaked some deformations on Hailey's waist and pregnant belly.
        CloudRigify:
        - Fixed a bug in cloud_bone where targetless constraints would fail to be re-targetted, since, they don't have a target.
        - Decided it's okay to add buttons to pre-existing Rigify UI, so I can now have custom generator settings.
        - Added Regenerate All Rigify Rigs operator that gets registered when CloudRig is loaded... I can't get unregister() to be called when it gets deactivated though, which is an issue.
        - CloudRig is no longer dependent on my MetsTools addon, so now is the first time it should really work straight off of github.
        - Refactored some code responsible for adding things to the Rig UI.
        - (Unrelated) Parameter UI is now organized in menus that can be closed. 

    Mar 20:
        CoffeeRun:
        - Fix crash for Pablico
        - rename some directly linked stuff from coffee to crowd_coffee. (unrelated to crash)
        CloudRig:
        spline_ik:
        - Found a workaround for the bug I reported the other day, so spline_ik rig works again.
        - Fixed a bug that caused the first and last handles to have the wrong length.
        - naming changes(deform bones, curve object)

        - Finish adding new drop-down UI to remaining rigs (spline_ik, spine)
        - Finish adding rig samples to remaining rigs (cloud_bone, spline_ik, chain, fk_chain). 

    Mar 23:
        Rain: Some weight tweaks on Rain's scarf and waist.
        CloudRig: Implemented support for arbitrary number of spine and neck bones into the spine rig.

    Mar 24:
        Day off due to eye problems.

    Mar 25:
        CoffeeRun: Rigged a tree.
        CloudRig:
        - Started splitting out code from cloud_limbs rig into a more generic cloud_ik_chain rig, which the limbs rig now inherits from.
        - Started some refactoring on cloud_chain code to make it more extendable.

    Mar 26:
        CloudRig:
        - More splitting out code from cloud_limbs into cloud_ik_chain, but still more to do before it's fully independent from cloud_limbs.
            - cloud_ik_chain can now be generated on its own for the first time(without relying on being inherited by cloud_limbs)
            - cloud_ik_chain now owns code for generating stretching setup, without breaking footroll on limbs. Still only supports a chain of 3 bones.
        - Add and implement various new parameters for IK chain:
            - Arbitrary chain length (WIP)
            - Pole target can be disabled, use first bone's rotation instead. This will assign a bone shape, group and layer to that bone.
        - Implement ability to hide parameters of inherited rig elements. I gave this a go before but it was a lot uglier than this new solution.
        Blender:
        - Tested and gave some feedback on the new experimental Menu Search (T74157)

    Mar 27:
        CloudRig:
        - cloud_ik_chain now fully supports IK stretch with an arbitrary length IK chain.
        - (TODO) Implement Custom IK Pole parameter  so the IK pole can be placed arbitrarily via the metarig.
        - (TODO) IK/FK snapping works on arbitrary length IK chain.
        Rain:
        - Fixed some missing drivers on subsurf modifiers that caused FPS to be cut in half.
        - Deleted new verts and replaced them with a masked Solidify modifier. Updated Rain v2.0.zip on Dropbox.
        Settlers:
        - Experimented with curves and stuff.

    Mar 30:
        Settlers:
        - More experimenting with curves and stuff, research
        CloudRig:
        - (For Settlers) Started planning and prepping code for a new kind of curve-based rig, but this time it would take a pre-existing curve.
            I would like the existing Spline IK rig to share code with this, since that one is curve-based as well, but it's a tricky code surgery, like when I was separating the IK Chain rig code from the Limb rig code.
        - Added short descriptions to all rig types to improve usability. They are displayed above their parameters.
        CoffeeRun:
        - Made pregnant Hailey's pants shorter.
        - Re-proxied all Haileys and Sunnys again in Hjalti, Pablo & Assembly files. This was needed because apparently bone custom properties don't update on proxies.

    Mar 31:
        CloudRig:
        - Curve rig is done, and shares code with the SplineIK rig.

April
    Apr 1:
        Settlers:
        - Experimenting with body rigging, extended discussion on the deformation of arms and legs, with an actual conclusion!
        CoffeeRun:
        - Rig Hailey's hospital gown
        - (make copies of Sunny with Julien's changes to the scrub)
        CloudRig:
        - Fix many small bugs that cropped up while testing things for Lunte.
        - Fix some tooltip inconsistencies and poor wording.

    Apr 2:
        Settlers:
        - Experimenting a lot with https://developer.blender.org/D6894 because it opened up a new possibility to do character deformations.
        I think it will be useful in the future, but for Settlers we pretty much want as many bones as there are vertices in the character, so abstracting the shape any further won't be of use
        - Trying to add extra stretch controls for Pablo but the geometry is limiting.

    Apr 3:
        Settlers:
        - Finished implementing the face rig after much pain.
        - Cleaned up the file
        CloudRig:
        - Added a generator parameter to run an arbitrary script file at the final stage of generation.
        - Fixed various bugs relating to curve rigs
        - Added a separate rig element specifically for Settler Mouth, which extends the basic Curve Rig. In the end this was only used to hook up a second curve to the hook bones, the same way the first curve is hooked up. Still, could be useful in the future.

        Some extra work in mega-overtime(non-stop till 6 am)
        - Fixed foot roll when stretching(Hailey & Lunte)
        - Work on automatic universal IK pole placement and IK angle determination. Works in most cases, but not quite all.

    Apr 4 (Saturday):
        CloudRig:
        - Finish IK pole magic. This allows me to remove a couple of parameters, to make the rig generator easier to use.
        - Move parent switch setup code from limb rig to ik_chain rig so any generic IK chain can have the feature. Made the code more general, and hacked around an issue.(in an okay way)
        - Fix choosing "Chest" as the IK arm parent not working when spine is on FK.
        - Fix error when IK/FK snapping when the IK rig doesn't use a pole target.
        - Fix unneccessary object/collection hiding in Curve rig, although it's still screwing up things on Lunte right now for some reason, even though I haven't touched it since yesterday, and then it worked fine... HMMMMM.
        Lunte:
        - Add shoulder bones to all limbs on Pablo's request
        - Experiment with a way to allow the hand to be rolled into a fist. Works okay but now need to code it.
        - Clean up weight painting.
        - Finalize surface deform usage on the arms. It's only used to a small extent, but it helps with deforming the ring.
        - Also attempted the same thing on the legs but for no discernable reason, it deformed like total crap compared to the arm, so I just cleaned up the weights as much as I could.
        - Hacked a fist roll thing and a backpack bone into the generated rig, just to test, I guess.

    Apr 6:
        Lunte:
        - Made face resistant to scaling (the curve objects now use a smarter setup and a few extra drivers to help adjust their width and length based on the head's world scale)
        - Tried my damndest to add support for the bevel object that Julien made for the mouth, but it's just impossible. There is no way to control when Blender decides the curve should just flip out.
        - Added some shading helper bones for Simon.
        - Helped Pablo troubleshoot a weird thing which I think is a bug with linked curves. It might come up again.
        - Added teeth to the rig, they are shrinkwrapped to the head and can be hidden individually with a custom property.

        - Helped Jeroen test some (welcome!) Weight Paint Overlay changes
        
    Apr 7:
        Lunte:
        - Came up with a solution to make the rings not stretch when the limbs are stretched, on Vivien's suggestion.
        - Rigged the tongue.
        - Rigged the hair.
        - Made some "smear" meshes for Pablico to append, duplicate and sculpt for smearing effects.
        - Added a parent for the top and bottom teeth.
        CloudRig:
        - Reworked how cloud_bone works, in that instead of cloning the ORG- bone, it just renames the ORG- bone... Not sure why I didn't do this before, it avoids many headaches.
        - Started adding support for custom prefix/suffix separators (currently it's hardcoded that bone names prefixes must be separated by - and suffixes by .) - still WIP though.
        - Started implementing a more robust way to manage Bone Groups and layers, but I'm not too confident on the design yet.
        - Minor text fixes.

    Apr 8:
        Lunte:
        - Reworked the teeth on Pablo's suggestions.
        - Made a couple of cloud posts
        - He can now sort of make a fist(after generation, without fiddling with it)
        - Made the belt deform more solidly.
        CloudRig:
        - Worked on new BoneGroup system. It's starting to come together, now just need to change the code everywhere where I create a bone, and it should be working at least as well as the old shitty system was. Then I can start getting crazy with it.

    Apr 9:
        CoffeeRun:
        - Douse a fire on hailey's knees.
        Settlers:
        - Set up an animation file for Pablo
        - Rigged a cube for Pablo.
        - Figuring out how to set up some empties for Simon to control the 2D tongue. It's probably not perfect.
        - 150 FoV production quality livestream participation.
        CloudRig:
        - New bonegroup system is fully implemented, the old one still needs to be ripped out.

    Apr 10:
        Settlers:
        - Gabby shirt discussions and rig brainstorming
        - Came up with a new idea for the tongue locators for Lunte, and after a few iterations it seems to work a lot better than the old one.
        CloudRig:
        - Nuked code relating to old bonegroup system.
        - Started hijacking Rigify's bone group and layer UI, replacing it with my own, and implementing new features that use it.
        - Generated rigs can now have unified select/active colors, just like in regular Rigify. (except there's a lot less clicking and redundant data involved!)

    Apr 14 (day after Easter):
        Settlers:
        - Prepared a metarig for Gabby, but waiting until tomorrow to start actual rigging since modeling still seems to be underway.
        CloudRig:
        - Been further looking into the ability to call register() and unregister() functions when the CloudRig featureset is installed or removed, so I could cleanly add or remove operators and change or un-change UI panels, etc.
        - CloudRig now uses its own Generator(the class that governs the rig generation process). This is something I've wanted to do since the beginning but didn't know how.
        - Improvements to Regenerate All Rigify Rigs operator. (use a more generalized way of ensuring objects are visible - moved that code to cloud_utils, might be useful for rigs that have to work with curve objects)
        When I hijacked rigify's bone group UI, it made me realize I could also hijack the Rigify Buttons UI, which holds the generator operator. 
        So now, if the rig is a cloudrig, I just have my own generator operator, which calls my own generator class! 
        Shame I didn't think of this before. Keeping this compatible with regular Rigify elements is not top priority, but would be nice.
        This will allow me to remove a lot of hacks, starting with moving object name management out of rig elements, and into the generator code.
        More to come.

    Apr 15:
        Settlers:
        - Added performance and shrinkwrap settings to Lunte, made some performance optimizations, and we discovered the power of Simplify and its stupid defualt settings ;)
        - Added some more teeth bones for Lunte.
        - Basic rig for Gabby so Hjalti can start doing something with her.
        - Worked on Gabby's body and sleeve deformation for the most of the day. It's now ready for some feedback.
        CloudRig:
        - Added Copy Rigify Parameters and Mirror Rigify Parameters operators to speed up and make more consistent the workflow of creating metarigs.
        - Some small fixes

    Apr 16:
        Settlers:
        - Lunte: More teeth bones, put shrinkwrap constraints back, sub-controls for teeth on separate layer, face quality now affects mask subdivision, backpack can be detached.
        - Gabby: Initial face rig, working better than I ever dared expect.

    Apr 17:
        Settlers:
        Gabby:
        - Learned about and worked around T59106...
        - This also removed the error spam from the console
        - Tweaked curve rig code so it can name its bones better if it has a side(.L/.R)
        Lunte:
        - Troubleshooting an issue for Pablo. I fixed it, but for some reason it's not propagating to his file... :/ Never found out what the issue was, had to ask him to re-make his file.

        More Menu Search shennanigans https://developer.blender.org/T74157

    Apr 20:
        Spent the morning discussing developer communication(prompted by sudden commit of Menu Search) in #blender-coders, and then even more with William in DMs.
        Settlers:
        - Hair, ear and goggles rigged for Gabby.
        - Started rigging Phileas - didn't test deformation yet, just setting up metarig (and hunting down some CloudRig issues)
        CloudRig:
        - The rig UI and the custom script execution code was moved from the rig elements to the generator, so it is only executed once per generation, instead of as many times as there are rig elements in the rig.
        - Removed a bone transform locking functionality that was copied from the original Rigify generator, and removed the hack that I used to work around it. (Rigify would lock any bone whose name started with 3 capital letters...)
        - Last FK bone on limb rigs(wrist/ankle) no longer displays in the middle of the bone like the rest of the chain.

    Apr 21:
        CloudRig:
        - A bugfix and some tweaks on SplineIK rig so it works with pre-existing curves, and works better with cyclic curves.
        - Implemented a new feature in CloudRig on Hjalti's request, so curve rigs can have a separate radius control.
        - Reset rig transforms during generation, so the Hook modifiers for curve rigs(and potentially other things) don't mess up if the target rig was moved.
        Settlers:
        - Fixed an pupil clipping mess on Gabby, and added some extra bones on her for Simon.
        - Started weight painting the body of Phileas.

    Apr 22:
        CloudRig:
        - Fix curve rig failing to generate when using UI button instead of operator.
        - Force cloud_bone bones to not be on Quaternion rotation.
        - Properties bone is no longer created until it's called for.
        - Tried to implement a generator parameter to disable creation of the Root bone, but it resulted in a bit of a mess, so I reverted it for now.
        Settlers:
        - Finished first pass on the body, hair and backpack for Phileas.
        - Started on some experiments for the eyes... the squashed spheres are gonna be tricky.
        - Fixed parent switching bug in CloudRig that was also present on Gabby.
        - Fixed intersection issues on Gabby.

    Apr 23:
        Settlers:
        - Phileas eyes, mouth and backpack rigged. Still need to add more control over the eyelid.
        - Addressed some issues and feedback from Pablo on Phileas.
        - Added shrinkwrap on Lunte's face parts for Simon.
        - Fix Gabby's freckles disappearing on some parts of her face.

    Apr 24:
        Settlers:
        - Tweaks on Gabby for Hjalti.
        - Eyelids rigged for Phileas.
        - Major clean-up on Lunte:
            - Fix various types of console spam (all unreasonable, of course)
            - Renamed face bones such that they are symmetrical, which is something Hjalti requested on Gabby.
            - Scaling the face parts now scales the outer tube correctly.
            - Stretching the head now stretches the face parts.
        CloudRig:
        - Reworked cloud_bone rig so it's a lot more hacky but a lot more functional. Need to hack it more later.

    Apr 25 (bored on Saturday):
        Settlers:
        - Continued and committed cleanup on Lunte. Earlier I saved over lunte.rig.blend with lunte.blend, which broke our "pipeline". Fixed that, and made it compatible with our new "pipeline".
        - Also went over all existing files where he was posed or animated, and made them all link from lunte.blend instead of various other files that either didn't exist or didn't have up to date shaders.
        - Finished and committed improvements to Phileas's eyelids, mouth and hair, brought to you by the cloud_bone rework from yesterday.

    Apr 27: King's day

    Apr 28:
        Settlers:
        - Re-made the mesh for the smear ring rig from Hjalti. Now it's a straight line, which lets us slide the mesh along a curve, to give it that sonic the hedgehog legs effect.
        - Fixed an issue on Lunte that made the teeth shift away.
        - Add teeth dummies for Gabby. I did not add a tongue dummy because I felt like the 2D representation didn't give really any sort of idea of how the tongue will actually look - it seemed more distracting than helpful.

    Apr 29:
        Settlers:
        - Some more troubleshooting on Lunte's teeth misalignment. Finally fixed it for reals.
        - Worked on Phileas based on feedback from Pablo
            - Bigger spine control
            - Better eye control shape
            - Add eye target controls
            - Make eyelids hidable
            - Mask out back parts of the eyelid meshes
            - Made smear meshes
            - Fix Knees bend a bit inwards by default with IK
            - Remove teeth bones that are no longer needed, rename the rest so none of them end in .00x.
        Blender:
            - Submitted D7571 to fix the final piece of Lunte error spam.

    Apr 30:
        Settlers:
        - Hook up Face Quality property to stuff on Gabby, like on Lunte.
        - Some cleanup on the release file
        Phileas:
        - More split up smear meshes
        - Fix smear meshes depending on rig
        - Added a middle head bone
        - Added eye lattice controls

May
    May 1:
        Moved back to the office, set up new blender user prefs, git repos and SVN.
        Settlers:
            - Some parenting fixes on Gabby
            Phileas:
                - Tweaked spine location and weights, in an attempt to reduce the amount of squishing happening on the backpack strap.
                - Made eye lattice controls horizontal instead of vertical, and made them 4 rows instead of 3, where the middle 2 are owned by the middle bone.
                - Additional control for the mid-point of the backpack straps on the sides
                - Fix a bug with the eyes
        Cloudrig:
            - Fixed bug where regular rigs would fail to get parented to cloud_bone rigs.
            - Fixed a bug where Stretch To constraints would get "-nan m" for their rest length, breaking them.
            - Fix an issue with spine rigs when there is no head bone, the last FK bone owns the STR- bone before it, which results in some funkyness. This should only be relevant for Phileas, since his head rig is a separate rig element.

    May 4:
        - Set up metarig for Pip 
        - Investigate Grease Pencil rigging... it's not very good. It's really bad actually, so I made a curve-based replica of the mouth. Not sure about the eyes yet, but will probably have a similar fate.
        CloudRig:
            - Fix the same bug on stretch constraints as yesterday, but better
            - Fix a bug on curve rigs where they would miss some controls when cyclic==False.
            - IK snapping now uses tail distance (simple maths) instead of rotation difference(complicated maths) to determine which way to put the IK pole. This fixes the snapping issues seen on Gabby and Lunte, but still isn't perfect.
            - Fix IK pole control having weird rotation (visual issue only)

    May 5: Dutch Liberation Day

    May 6:
        - Started implementing bone group and bone layer parameters, so they can be customized on each rig element. Not usable yet, but the UI is there and I think it will work out nicely.
        - Cleaned up cloudrig.py before Sybren tears it apart on the livestream.
        - Made short video on Gabby rigging process for the supercut video.

    May 7:
        - Realizing that a lot of people are trying to learn from cloudrig.py, I added and clarified a ton more comments and renamed some variables to make it as easy to learn from as possible.
        - Posted rig walkthrough video
        - Made eye curves for Pip, still no weights though.
        - Massive progress on the Bone Group system on CloudRig. Now each rig element can assign its set of bones to any arbitrary bone group and assign them to any arbitrary set of layers. It can still be improved by adding rig-wide overrides for certain bone sets, and implementing a customizable bone layer UI. But for now, I can finally move face/hair/finger/clothes related bones to the layers they belong, 100% of the time.
        - Did some tweaks on Phileas that were requested by Pablo and Simon. Also applied the new bone layer tech to his metarig, so all his bones are now nicely organized.

    May 8:
        - Improve reliability of curve rig generation in CloudRig, and better error reporting for when it fails.
        - Finish rigging Pip, including a new mouth shape, all the weight painting, modifiers and drivers. Still some discussion to be had on how to handle the eyes, but I want to wait until he gets some testing.

    May 11:
        - Lots of troubleshooting on Phileas.
        - Trying to hunt down why the boolean modifier on Phileas's mouth is behaving erratically. Managed to get it to break a lot less often with Simon's help.
        - Some changes for Pip requested by Hjalti.

    May 12: Took a day off.

    May 13:
        - Fix some bone layer assingment issues on Phileas.
        CloudRig:
        - Bone layers no longer use ugly magic numbers.
        - Started implementing customizable Layers UI.

    May 14:
        - Various small fixes on Pip for Hjalti
        CloudRig:
        - Fully implemented customizable rig layer UI!!!
        - Implement layer assignment override for Deform/Mechanism/Org bone sets.
        - Pre-made MetaRigs (eg. Cloud_Human) are now appended from a .blend file rather than having to be encoded into a generation code, and then re-generated from that code.

        - Move Widget management code to the Generator code, and improve it such that a Widgets collection is always created if it isn't found, is always hidden, and is named after the rig.
        - Moved root control layer assignment parameters into the Generator code.
        - Moved CloudRig generator parameters into a PropertyGroup to avoid cluttering python api
        - Moved Bone Sets parametergroup from the top to the bottom of parameter UI, to better indicate that the available layer assignments are affected by the preceeding parameters.

        - Active and protected rig layers are now copied from the metarig
        - Armature display modes are now copied from the metarig
        - Clean up various hackarounds that are no longer needed

        - Update Gabby with the new features. Phileas also almost done.

    May 15:
        - Fixed the tiniest of Blender bugs :) D7744
        - Did a lot of refactoring in bone.py to make the code a lot more readable and sensible. Inspired by Sybren :)
        - Fix a backwards compatibility issue with existing animations on Gabby
        - Finish updating Phileas with latest CloudRig features. Also did Lunte but running into some issues...

    May 18:
        - Fix scale inheritance issue that I ran into while trying to update Lunte to latest CloudRig. Problem also existed on other characters, so updated those again too.
        - Made it easier to parent things to bendy bones(which should be done with Armature constraints, which need to be at the top of the constraint stack)
        - Fix Layers UI relying on Rigify addon to be enabled
        - Minor fixes on Pip's hair for Hjaltin
        - Crossed off some TODO's in cloud_limbs.
        - Experimented with a bone group selection color feature where instead of toggling between having all bone groups use the same selected/active color, we have a blend factor, but it turned out pretty useless/bad so I just nuked the whole thing.
        - Finally figured out how to prevent rig_ui.py from being created... it was... stupidly simple.
        - Planned out some documentation, a potential eye tracking rig, and the outline of some videos I want to make for the cloud.

    May 19:
        - Some changes and fixes on Pip for Simon
        - Made most of a video about how I set up Pip's metarig. Editing with Blender is so painful, I've vowed to never do it again.

    May 20:
        - Fix a double parenting issue on Gabby
        - Submitted a fix for Rigify (D7801)
        CloudRig:
        - Added support for vector customproperties being displayed in the rig UI.
        - Started a Wiki on the github page.
        - Wrote in-depth documentation on the bone organization system https://github.com/Mets3D/CloudRig/wiki/Organizing-Bones
        - Wrote in-depth documentation on the custom property system https://github.com/Mets3D/CloudRig/wiki/Custom-Properties

    May 21: Ascension Day (holiday)

    May 22:
        - Finish Pip metarig video
        - Implement prop_hierarchy so custom properties can be hierarchical. Need to write documentation.

    May 25:
        - Posted Pip metarig video https://cloud.blender.org/p/settlers/5ecb83e1d2d0a4657a7637df
        - Implement Create Root Bone generator parameter, so rigs can be generated without a root bone.
        - Fix some Armature constraints not working when they should...
        - Spent some time learning about GitLab and migrating CloudRig to it. Realized I have some unpushed changes on my home PC, so I'll get those merged first and then start committing on GitLab. Will have to shuffle the ReadMe around a bit.
        - Wrote in-depth documentation on each rig type 
        - Was trying to get said documentation to be accessible from within Blender. Failed, and ended up working on a patch for that. (D7837)
        - Started rigging Pip car.

    May 26:
        - Finish migration to GitLab.
        - Finished rigging Pip car and van.
        CloudRig:
            Start major refactoring efforts to reduce the areas where I'm re-implementing Rigify functions. 
            This does require hacking around Rigify limitations, 
            which were the reason I re-implemented stuff my way in the first place, 
            but my hope is that one day I will make patches to fix these things upstream.

            - Refactored constraint management so I can now call Rigify's make_constraint() function to create my constraint.
            - Constraint data is now saved in its own class. Hopefully this won't get as bloated as the BoneInfo class.

            - Got rid of all use cases of utils.copy_attributes() which was a messy piece of recursive clusterfuck. Deleted utils.py.
            - Delete settlers_mouth rig as I never ended up using it, and it was pretty pointless.

            - Started refactoring drivers, not so happy with the results so far. Also Rigify won't let me create variables that target a datablock type other than Object. Yet another thing to fix upstream.

    May 27:
        - Finish refactoring drivers.
        - Added color properties to Pip for Simon to hook up to the shaders.
        - Pip: Fix scale propagation issue on face and wrong thickness of mouth.
        - Refactor how I manage custom properties to something a lot more sane. This could be upstreamed to Rigify also.

    May 28:
        - Tested D7855
        - Fully refactored BoneGroup, BoneInfoContainer and BoneGroupContainer into one superior BoneSet class.
        - Deleted bone_group.py, id.py as they were no longer needed.
        - Basically same deal as previous refactoring efforts. The code structure is really starting to make a lot more sense now.
        Need to fix a bug with root bone scale tho...

    May 29:
        - Celebrate CoffeeRun premiere, be on livestream
        - Fix some toe drivers that got flipped during refactor
        - Fix root bone shape scale exploding
        - Curve rigs UI fixes and code cleanup

June 2:
    - Fix another issue with Pip's toe.
    - Fix Rigify Buttons panel in edit mode was not working.
    - Fix regular Rigify types throwing error with CloudRig generator. Although full compatibility with regular Rigify is not really a goal, it should at least manage to generate.
    - Fix IK/FK switching not working on the spine
    - Moved a bunch of functionality that belonged in the FK chain code, into the FK chain code.

June 3:
    - Fix some issues on Rain for Pablo.
    Took 3/4 of the day off due to eye pain. It continued at home, even after several hours of taking the lense out. Strange.

June 4:
    - Some cleanup on Pip so Simon can do a V1 release.
    - Improve mouth weights on Rain for Pablo.
    - CloudRig:
        - Fix rigify compatibility mode always being enabled instead of only when needed.
        - Fix cloud_spline_ik not working in some cases, and not updating the generated curve in other cases.
        - Finish documentation of custom properties and curve rig types.

June 5: Day off due to eye pain.

June 8:
    - Script, record, edit first 6 minutes of weight painting tutorial

June 9:
    - Script, record, edit another 3 minutes of weight painting tutorial. Showed it to a friend for feedback, found some audio balance issues. Considering cutting into multiple parts soon.
    - Some troubleshooting for Pablo.
    - Some discussions on a Rigify patch with Ivan Cappiello and Alexander Gavrilov.

June 10:
    - Fix an error on Pip/CloudRig for Hjalti.
    - Figure out how to fix audio and render from Resolve, and rendered first version of the first part of the weight painting tutorial. At this pace it looks like it could be a 3-4 parter.
    - Got my first fix committed for Rigify. Have ideas for a lot more, but will have to see what time allows.

June 11:
    - Split off the weight painting tools from MetsTools into a new EasyWeight addon on gitlab.
    - Started looking at what I could contribute to Rigify.
        In doing so I realized it could really use unit tests.
        I started learning about unit tests with some guidance from Sybren.
        Managed to get baby's first unit test working, detecting missing bones in the generated rig. Woohoo!

June 12:
    - Worked more on Rigify rig generation unit testing.
    - Changes in bone properties, constraints, bone custom properties are detected.
    - Changes in drivers of bone properties and constraint properties are detected.
    This more or less covers everything, so next time I will start actually working on a Rigify commit and use this test to make sure I don't break anything.
    In future I can also use this for testing CloudRig refactors, which would've been very helpful some time ago.

    - Set up both upstairs and downstairs recording rooms so I don't have to do it at home.


June 15:
    - Scripted and recorded audio for weight painting tutorial part 2.
    - Made D8041

June 16
    - Tested D7499
    Rain:
        - Updated her to latest cloudrig functionality.
        - Viewport Display panel works again... /wrists
        - Reimplemented old "Enable Modifiers" button as a shiny new Quality slider.
        - Troubleshooting mask modifier performance drop for Pablo, it turned out to be this old problem T68740.
        - Added python app handler workaround, should have good performance while masks are turned on now.
    - Got final cut of audio for weight painting tutorial part 2, just need video.
