Addon ideas:
	Selection Sets + Select Similar
		Add an operator to Selection Sets addon that lets you select one from a list of selection sets, which is the list of selection sets that any of the currently selected bones are in. On confirm, select all bones belonging to that selection set.
	
	Make a better Shift+D (duplicate bone) behaviour, where instead of slamming a .001 at the end of the bone name, it increments whatever number it finds in the bone name, and it does the same on the right side.
	Add Copy Custom Properties to the Copy Attributes addon.

	Add a proper Rigging panel to the Properties editor.
		This would have the following panels:
		- Object->Relations (With no Pass Index or axes)
		- Armature Display
			X-ray, axes, shapes, names, group colors, armature display type.
		- Object Constraints
		- Bone Constraints
		- Bone Display
		 - Put "hide" in the panel header so no need for Custom Shape to be a separate drop-down.
		- Custom Properties
			- Object
