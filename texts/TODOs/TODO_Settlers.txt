Settlers TODO:
	Phileas:
		- His mouth bones are named with the wrong sides, and was released that way in V1, yikes!
	Lunte:
		- Add new masking tech to the teeth, rename bones.
		- Teeth names could use some love, but then gotta run the curve renaming script on everything again.
		- Eye names aren't symmetrical - do it like gabby. I think the right eye's curves should be scaled -1 in edit mode, maybe?
