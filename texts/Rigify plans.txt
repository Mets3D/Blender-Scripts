Rigify plans

- Split the space switching into a separate addon
- Make rig generation not fail when target rig is hidden (use EnsureVisible class).
- UI improvements
    - Lowercase words, crappy icons, operators indistinguishable from toggle buttons
    - Enum drop-downs with the word "manual" in them for no reason.

- Add some Operators
    - Mirror Rigify Parameters
    - Copy Rigify Parameters
        - Add this to Copy Attributes menu if that addon is enabled.
        - Won't this fail depending on addon load order though?
    - Regenerate All Rigify Rigs
        - I guess this still goes in the Rigify menu that's only visible when you have a metarig selected, but the poll function won't check the active object since there's no need.
        - This also uses EnsureVisible, which is kinda meh. If we include EnsureVisible then we might as well use it for regular rig generation - which we should tbh.
- Rip out Legacy
- Add links to external feature sets (Legacy, CloudRig, MAD, AnGavrilov experiments, more?)
- CloudRig bone group system
- Scale independency
- BBone Scale for Bone Shape sizes
- Store Metarigs and samples in one or more .blend files instead of text.
- Face chain rig that works like mine
    - Action set-up system
- Log system
