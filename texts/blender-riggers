Here are some things I could bring up in #blender-riggers:

- How to achieve Tangent+Automatic BBones better than what I did (very complicated to explain what I did though)
- Why does the Transformation constraint overwrite scale rather than offset, so that we could have multiple transformation constraints on a single bone that target the scale?
- Pros and cons of IK Stretch and is there a way to mitigate the cons?
- Anyone got fancy finger or spine rigs? ;_;
