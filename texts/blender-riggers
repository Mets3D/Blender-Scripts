Here are some things I could bring up in #blender-riggers:

To Alexander: Would it be possible to store add more space options, for example one that only includes animation curve transforms?
    The issue is that right now, Local Space includes constraints + animation, but in some cases we want to ignore constraints.
    I should show an example of this.
To Alexander: Would it be possible to add a BBone handle type that combines Tangent+Automatic?
- How to achieve Tangent+Automatic BBones better than what I did (very complicated to explain what I did though)
- Why does the Transformation constraint overwrite scale rather than offset, so that we could have multiple transformation constraints on a single bone that target the scale?
- Pros and cons of IK Stretch and is there a way to mitigate the cons?
- Anyone got fancy finger or spine rigs? ;_;
