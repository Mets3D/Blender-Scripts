The current hotkey editor in blender is not very user friendly or easy to use.

Here are some things it should be able to do:
    - Operator search.
    - The right click->Assign/Change Shortcut button should bring up the hotkey editor so users have proper access to the settings of the hotkey after they set it up.
    - Conflict warning
    - Better Visualization (with graphics of an actual keyboard layout)
    - Not need to set up the same shortcut several times

Ideas:
    - Let shortcuts be aware of what mode (and Tool within that mode) they are assigned to, as opposed to having modes and tools with a list of shortcuts inside them.
        - This would avoid having to set up and maintain several of the same shortcuts.
    - Weight Paint and Pose mode should either be considered the same mode, or should otherwise somehow be indicated that their shortcuts can conflict.
    - The keyboard visualization would let you select which mode you want to see the hotkeys of.
        - You can click on a key to see the shortcuts containing that key. Eg. if you set the mode to Object mode and select the "G" key it will show the shortcuts "G" and "Alt+G".
