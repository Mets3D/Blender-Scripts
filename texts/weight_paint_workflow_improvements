Weight Paint mode is still cancer. I need some scripts to make it less cancer.

Issue 1: The main issue is random bones getting random weights on random vertices.
Solution:On Depsgraph update, run Clean Weights operator with 0.001 limit. Probably causes infinite loop, not sure if possible, but it would be really nice.

If that's not enough: Should look into my old "clean weight islands" script, see if it works, and if it does, hotkey it.

Issue 2: My addon I already use for switching brushes with 1, 2, 3 is working nicely, but it would be cool to:
    - make it set brush colors
    - If the brushes don't exist in the file, create them.

Issue 3: Switching to weight paint mode is still a pain in the ass.
    - Revive old script that used to cause crashes, see if it still causes crashes.

Issue 4: Projected/Sphere projection not being global is a pain in the ass. Make an operator that toggles it globally. (To the opposite of the current brush's setting)
    Bind it to X.
    Could even use brush color to indicate the state of this. I would set Value from 1.0 to 0.8 to indicate that it's set to Sphere.

Idea: Make a custom context menu on W key. This would have:

    - Front Faces Only (make global via callback? Is that possible?)
    - Falloff mode (global)
    - Auto-normalize

    - X-mirror
    - Bone Display mode
    - In Front
