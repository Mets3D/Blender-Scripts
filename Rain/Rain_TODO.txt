Body/Limbs
	HIGH Waist weights are a bit wonky and maybe the pivot point should be a bit higher up.
	
	HIGH Pivot of Spine2_FK is too far back
		Maybe get curved spine back, just make sure controls are world-aligned.
	HIGH Make IK foot shapes bigger. 
    HIGH Let shoulder rotate on local Y axis without breaking as much. FK-Shoulder.L
    HIGH Rerig shoulder for T-pose lmao

	MEDIUM Lower shin shouldn't rotate so much with the foot
	MEDIUM Upper thigh is following knee pole vector too much.

	LOW Ankle thing shouldn't move so much when foot is rotated.	
	LOW Knee deform is a bit wonky, especially on clothes
	LOW Knee is too round like the elbow.
	LOW FK-Clavicle bone is currently redundant(always follows IK)
	LOW Rebuild Soft IK tech with Likkez's tech, see if we can't eliminate all downsides. If it works, Apply it to the arms too.
    LOW The end of the shoulder and the start of the elbow being a separate toon control mean that the two controls are in the same place and overlap, so if we keep this, make sure to add unique bone shapes.
	LOW Scaling any parent of STR-Elbow.L fucks up the IK stretching trick on it.
    LOW We could hook up the Y scale of stretch controls to the Ease In/Out values, the X and Z scale values to the Bbone X/Y In/Out scales, via drivers.

Fingers
	HIGH Make sure all bone shapes are visible without x-ray (middle finger)
	HIGH Shape of FK-Thumb1.L should be like the carpals.
	HIGH Finger local Y rotation is broken again.
		When I unbroke it, I unbroke it by accidently enabling BBones because then the finger deform bones use BBone handles for rotation. Make it work like that but without BBones.

    MEDIUM In general but wrist especially, make sure the outer parts of bends stay a bit "sharper" (or less round)
	MEDIUM Adjust thumb pivot point, see how good it can be, make sure we can make a decent fist.
    MEDIUM Elbow and wrist and maybe other things roll a bit when they shouldn't, eg. rotating elbow on local X results in some roll in DEF-Shoulder2.L.
    
	LOW Overall deform improvements for fingers
    LOW Try making shoulder weights a bit broader.    
		
Clothes
	MEDIUM Shirt is wonky in the front and back when hips are moved
	MEDIUM Come up with something to make the shirt not look glued to her skin.
	LOW Tongue of the shoes moves with the foot.

Face
	Add sneer control
	Add smile control

	Think about how to add more lower level control for the eyebrows.
	Add lattice controls for the head and the eye.
	Hook up the scale of CTR bones to the bbone scale of deform bones.

On release/updates
    Make sure Armature modifiers are in the right place in the stack(ie. above SubSurf)
    Lock object transforms
    Make sure bones, objects, shapes, and object data are named properly
    Make sure bbone display size is consistent
