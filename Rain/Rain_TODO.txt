I got a segfault while setting up a mask modifier :thinking:
I also got a crash when using the new remesh button with a completely invalid mesh by randomly extruding a vert, then two unrelated vert, then an edge, then the whole mess, from the default cube.

I should set up an operator and keybind for setting or toggling 2D falloff and auto normalize in weight paint mode. They should also always be shown in the UI.

Body/Limbs
	MEDIUM In general but wrist especially, make sure the outer parts of bends stay a bit "sharper" (or less round) and don't lose as much volume.
		LOW Knee deform is a bit wonky, especially on clothes
		LOW Knee is too round like the elbow.

	LOW Try making shoulder weights a bit broader.
		I don't know, it feels quite broad to me already.
	LOW We could hook up the Y scale of stretch controls to the Ease In/Out values, the X and Z scale values to the Bbone X/Y In/Out scales, via drivers.
	
	LOW Upper thigh is following knee pole vector too much.
		I don't think this can really be fixed easily.
	
	NEXT RIG Completely rework the way deformation adjusters are implemented. They need to stop relying on the local rotation of *anything* because that shit is unreliable. Rotation values in general should pretty much only drive anything if the thing doing the driving can only rotate on one axis, so, never. Because rotations are fucking weird.
		Instead, a stretch target should be parented to the joint, and the deform adjuster should stretch to that target. Then it's just a matter of parenting the deform adjuster itself appropriately.
		Or maybe try the muscle system addon.
	NEXT RIG Stretch controls are kind of a total mess right now, especially when it comes to rotating them.
		The end of the shoulder and the start of the elbow being a separate toon control mean that the two controls are in the same place and overlap, so if we keep this, make sure to add unique bone shapes.
		Scaling any parent of STR-Elbow.L fucks up the IK stretching trick on it.
	NEXT RIG Rebuild Soft IK tech with Likkez's tech, see if we can't eliminate all downsides. If it works, Apply it to the arms too.
	
Fingers
	MEDIUM Elbow and wrist and maybe other things roll a bit when they shouldn't, eg. rotating elbow on local X results in some roll in DEF-Shoulder2.L.
	
	LOW Overall deform improvements for fingers
		
Clothes
	MEDIUM Shirt is wonky in the front and back when hips are moved
	MEDIUM Come up with something to make the shirt not look glued to her skin.

Face
	Add sneer control
	Add smile control

	Think about how to add more lower level control for the eyebrows.
	Add lattice controls for the head and the eye.
	Hook up the scale of CTR bones to the bbone scale of deform bones.

On release/updates
	Apply mirror modifier on the body and fix the UV islands where needed.
	Maybe join the UV layers into one? I don't like having them separate. I'd rather just offset them by 1 UV tile to the right.
	Make sure Armature modifiers are in the right place in the stack(ie. above SubSurf)
	Lock object transforms
	Make sure bones, objects, shapes, and object data are named properly
	Make sure bbone display size is consistent
	Clean up bone shapes collection, maybe make a script to resize bones to a uniform scale and then adjust bone shape settings accordingly so they maintain their display size.
