I think I'll need a script to split shape keys into left/right parts and set up drivers accordingly. (I guess have the left-side driver on the original shape-key, then just flip that over to the new right side shape key)

In a few days, Transformation constraints that scale should be changed to multiplicative blend mode.

Body/Limbs
	HIGH Re-do Thigh deforms with shape keys
	HIGH We should never disable Inherit Rotation, because it breaks the functionality of the ROOT bone. Hinge settings need to use a Copy Transforms constraint targetting a mechanism bone.
	HIGH DRV- bones should be deleted, and driven bones and shape keys should instead use the new Swing feature.
	
	MEDIUM improve Spine_Fwd shape key. More of the same, reduce the curvature of the back.
	MEDIUM The Spine control causes the length of the spine to reduce a little bit at extreme forward rotation. Could try having a sub-control that moves when it's rotated, but then it might feel like it's sliding around. So maybe just play with the pivot point.

	MEDIUM Re-visit the elbow.

	NEXT RIG Completely rework the way deformation adjusters are implemented. They need to stop relying on the local rotation of *anything* because that shit is unreliable. Rotation values in general should pretty much only drive anything if the thing doing the driving can only rotate on one axis, so, never. Because rotations are fucking weird.
		Instead, a stretch target should be parented to the joint, and the deform adjuster should stretch to that target. Then it's just a matter of parenting the deform adjuster itself appropriately.
		Or maybe try the muscle system addon.
	NEXT RIG Stretch controls are kind of a total mess right now, especially when it comes to rotating them.
		The end of the shoulder and the start of the elbow being a separate toon control mean that the two controls are in the same place and overlap, so if we keep this, make sure to add unique bone shapes.
		Scaling any parent of STR-Elbow.L fucks up the IK stretching trick on it.
		LOW We could hook up the Y scale of stretch controls to the Ease In/Out values, the X and Z scale values to the Bbone X/Y In/Out scales, via drivers.
	NEXT RIG Rebuild Soft IK tech with Likkez's tech, see if we can't eliminate all downsides. If it works, Apply it to the arms too.
	
Fingers
	LOW Add deform adjusters for fingers.
		
Clothes
	MEDIUM Shirt is wonky in the front and back when hips are moved
	MEDIUM Come up with something to make the shirt not look glued to her skin.

Face
	Add sneer control
	Add smile control

	Think about how to add more lower level control for the eyebrows.
	Add lattice controls for the head and the eye.
	Hook up the scale of CTR bones to the bbone scale of deform bones.

On release/updates
	Apply mirror modifier on the body and fix the UV islands where needed.
	Maybe join the UV layers into one? I don't like having them separate. I'd rather just offset them by 1 UV tile to the right.
	Make sure Armature modifiers are in the right place in the stack(ie. above SubSurf)
	Lock object transforms
	Make sure bones, objects, shapes, and object data are named properlyRNA_DEF_CURVEBONE_UPDATE
	Make sure bbone display size is consistent
	Clean up bone shapes collection, maybe make a script to resize bones to a uniform scale and then adjust bone shape settings accordingly so they maintain their display size.
