I should make an addon to help the editing of shape keys and weights in any order.
	Let me weight paint after saving the geometry of a mesh with a certain shape key, then have an option to re-adjust the shape key with the new weights to give the same shape.
		It would be best if this could run on every brush stroke, but I guess that won't be possible.
	Figure out how to make it so that, in order to achieve a desired shape, the weights are re-distributed such that the least amount of work possible has to be done by shape keys, while everything else is done by bones.
		This seems super difficult, since bones can do a lot of things, like move, rotate, and scale, while shape keys can only move along a line.

HIGH Write a document on what could be done on blender development side to make my workflow better.
	Well I did, several, bug reports.

RAIN
Nuke Hail!
Body/Limbs
	Scale propagation
		Knee, butt and shoulder deform correctives need to be replaced by shape keys.
			They are also currently parented to STR- bones, which is not necessarily bad but probably worth noting?
				The reason for this is because DEF- bones don't inherit scale, they get their scale from BBone scale, which can only be inherited by Armature Constraint, which works poorly in this case for some reason.
					This does mean that we cannot parent anything to DEF- bones, which is not ideal.

Face
	HIGH Action Constraint fix is now in master, so delete CTR-P- or whatever-they-are-now bones, and rename action curves with script while trying not to break anything.
		Tried doing this, it broke everything. For some reason the N- bones rely on these parent bones existing. Maybe they don't have to, I'm not sure. Feel like there might not be much point in figuring it out. Can just keep this mess on Rain, and probably use more shape-key based face rigs in the future.
		Keep in mind when re-generating face controls: Eyelids shouldn't affect eyerings, and eyebrows shouldn't affect themselves, that is to say, automatic bbone handle should be disabled on these areas. Same for lips.
		With that said, a lot of the bones from those areas should be able to be deleted.
	
	Maybe delete old action based eyering controls (and their relevant actions and constraints)?
	Delete unused face deform bones
	Delete unused auto+tangent helpers
	
	NEXT RIG Maybe lip corner can be oriented to the curvature of the lip so when moved on local Z the mouth corner doesnt have to be manually pushed in by the animator, but can still be adjusted.

	LOW Merge body and head
	LOW Try weighting the gums to the face bones? Not sure about this... But I guess at least for the front area of the gums it could work and could be useful. Worth an experiment if we have the time.
	LOW MSTR-Eyering_Upper is an exposed control with a translating Action constraint... Not ideal, but not worth fixing for now.

Final Cleanup
	We used to have some bones next to the ROOT bone that were used to organize bones that used Armature Constraint for parenting. What happened with that setup? I want it back.

	- disable auto smooth on all objects
	- clear custom normals on all objects 

	Find constraints that are disabled and remove them.
	Make sure no invalid constraints or drivers exist (and driver is not showing any warnings of any kind)
	DONE Make script to nuke unnecessary curves in actions (performance boost).
	Set "dev" custom property on the rig to 0 to hide mech layers from the UI.
	Ensure UVs are fixed.
	Make sure Armature modifiers are in the right place in the stack(ie. above SubSurf)
	Lock object transforms? Disable selectability?
	Make sure bones, objects, shapes, object data and shape key blocks are named properly.
	Make sure armature looks decent in all display modes. (no oversized envelopes or bbones, even with bone shapes disabled)
	Clean up bone shapes collection, maybe make a script to resize bones to a uniform scale and then adjust bone shape settings accordingly so they maintain their display size.
