Rain Face Timeline
Some notes about the current state of each area of Rain's face rig:
	Eyes - (As far as I'm concerned) Basically done, just needs minor polish.
	Eyebrows - Almost done, but might need some adjustments or more low level controls, which could prove challenging, but imo these are non-essential improvements.
	Nose - As far as I'm concerned done, but didn't get feedback on it yet. I don't expect any challenges.
	Mouth - These areas need a lot of work and iteration.
		Lips & Cheeks - Not much functionality right now. Probably going to be the hardest part. I have some idea of what the animators want, but I expect there will be a lot of back and forth on this.
		Jaw - Works fairly well imo, but never showed it to animators yet. Just need to make sure it continues to work well while we're making changes to the lips & cheeks.

With these things in mind, here's my estimate of how long finishing the face might take:
Week 1: (hopefully starting Sept 23)
	- Rig teeth and tongue. I don't expect any issues or much need for iteration here.
	- Get feedback on jaw, eyes, eyebrows & nose so they can be finished.
Week 2: (Sept 29)
	====Schedule offset by 2 days for scale discussions and fix===
	- Initial implementation of lip & cheek controls. (No shape keys yet) I expect lots of iteration needed for this.
Week 3: 
	- Implement feedback on eyes, eyebrows & nose, including shape keys where needed. Hopefully this is their final state.
	- Implement feedback on jaw. I expect this to be minimal... Major changes to this could be a big problem. Stashing the feedback away for the next project is always an option ;)
	- Add lattice controls. (More can be added any time, on demand.)
	- Some more work on lip & cheek controls, and gathering feedback.
Week 4-5:
	- Implement feedback on lip & cheek -> get feedback -> repeat many times.
	- Once we are fairly happy and are down to smaller changes, start adding shape keys.
	- Finalize lip & cheek controls.
Week 6:
	- More polish, mirror everything and make sure it doesn't break.

After the face is done, there is still some wrap-up work to do before we can call the entire rig finished.
Week 7-8:
	- Rigging the hair (if we need anything fancy, but this is probably non-essential.)
	- Rigging the clothes (this will be a bit tricky, since we can't transfer shape keys between meshes easily... I expect some unique problems...)
	- Final cleanup, making sure everything is consistently named, organized, WORKS, etc.
	- Ready to show to the world....??



I should make an addon to help the editing of shape keys and weights in any order.
	Let me weight paint after saving the geometry of a mesh with a certain shape key, then have an option to re-adjust the shape key with the new weights to give the same shape.
		It would be best if this could run on every brush stroke, but I guess that won't be possible.
	Figure out how to make it so that, in order to achieve a desired shape, the weights are re-distributed such that the least amount of work possible has to be done by shape keys, while everything else is done by bones.
		This seems super difficult, since bones can do a lot of things, like move, rotate, and scale, while shape keys can only move along a line.

Write a document about some of the challenges and improvements made over the past few weeks, include the videos.
Write a document about how the rig could be replicated on a new character. What scripts need to be written, etc.
To make a rig generator, I need to learn how to use the new Rigify.

Body/Limbs
	LOW FK-Thumb2.R rotation should affect palm bulge
	MEDIUM I think thigh might need some updates to be up to date with current shoulder tech. I wonder if its twist is managed(countered) correctly in IK mode.
	MEDIUM Improve shoulder deformation
	
	Scale propagation
		Knee, butt and shoulder deform correctives need to be replaced by shape keys.
			They are also currently parented to STR- bones, which is not necessarily bad but probably worth noting?
				The reason for this is because DEF- bones don't inherit scale, they get their scale from BBone scale, which can only be inherited by Armature Constraint, which works poorly for some reason.
					This does mean that we cannot parent anything to DEF- bones, which is not ideal.
		Teeth need Copy Scale constraints just like face deform bones. Make sure this is the first constraint in the stack.

	LOW If we have some extra time, I'd like to try to re-add the Auto-Clavicle functionality as an option.

	DONE Stretch controls are kind of a total mess right now, especially when it comes to rotating them.
		Scaling any parent of STR-Elbow.L fucks up the IK stretching trick on it.
		We could hook up the Y scale of stretch controls to the Ease In/Out values, the X and Z scale values to the Bbone X/Y In/Out scales, via drivers.

Clothes
	HIGH Write a script to transfer shape keys from base mesh to the clothes with Surface Deform modifier. Also need to copy drivers, and then clean up weights and shape keys.
	MEDIUM Come up with something to make the shirt not look glued to her skin.


Face
	Keep in mind when re-generating face controls: Eyelids shouldn't affect eyerings, and eyebrows shouldn't affect themselves, that is to say, automatic bbone handle should be disabled on these areas. Same for lips.
	With that said, a lot of the bones from those areas should be able to be deleted.

	Limit Location and Action constraints in some circumstance don't seem to mirror correctly(see MouthCorner_In action)

	DONE Lip roll should affect the corners a lot less, and not aim for so much a kiss shape, but instead aim for just rolling the lips in whatever pose they're in.
	DONE It should roll over the teeth, so made with the assumption that it's used when the mouth is open. If we have time, can try to do something clever to make it work when the mouth is closed.

	Rotation of lip corner control should affect the... rotation of the corner of the lips.
	Add a lip zip functionality to scaling lip corner controls. If possible, make it so that scaling the bone up makes the lip shape more round.

	DONE(maybe too much) LipWide action should squash the lips, to make them preserve volume.

	DONE? Make the nostrils react less to Lip_Wide and more to Lip_UpDown.
	Give face CTR- bones some colors.

	Maybe delete old action based eyering controls (and their relevant actions and constraints)?

	LOW (Kinda DONE?) Try to see if eyebrow CTR bones can behave a bit better when rotated, but not high priority.
	
	When lips roll in, moustache area should 1.) have some way to be controlled 2.) be a bit more puffy.
		Same for lower lip. Lower moustache area. This can probably only be done with shape keys. Set it up the same way as the cheek puff, should be fine.

	Eyering CTR- bones should copy scale from their MSTR controls instead of the MSTR control one layer above(MSTR-Eyering)
	But then again, I'm not a fan of these copy scale constraints to begin with. I need to remind myself why they exist.
		I guess I did them because the face setup script relies on DEF- bones being parented as chains.
		But this is utterly flawed. This scale must be inherited from the CTR- parents appropriately. Copy Scale != Inherit Scale. That said, an Inherit Scale constraint would be interesting.
		Idea: 
			Store DEF- children in a custom property, then if we still need the face setup script we can rely on that custom property instead of the actual child.
			Then parent DEF- bones to CTR- bones and inherit some sort of scale, and nuke the Copy Scale constraints, and hope that doesn't work like shit.

	Slap some simple shape keys in there to get the nose wrinkles and better eyebrow shapes, at least when moved with the master control.

	LOW Adjust weighting of the gums, such that they are weighted to face bones? Not sure about this... But I guess at least for the front area of the gums it could work and could be useful. Worth an experiment if we have the time.

	Clean up weights on the inner mesh of the throat and mouth cavity.

	MSTR-Eyering_Upper is an exposed control with a translating Action constraint... Not ideal, but not worth fixing for now.

	NEXT RIG Hook up the scale of CTR bones to the bbone scale of deform bones.
	NEXT RIG Think about how to add more lower level control for the eyebrows.

On release/updates
	Find constraints that are disabled and remove them.
	Make sure no invalid constraints or drivers exist (and driver is not showing any warnings of any kind)
	Make script to nuke unnecessary curves in actions (performance boost).
	Set "dev" custom property on the rig to 0 to hide mech layers from the UI.
	Fix UVs if they weren't already?
	Make sure Armature modifiers are in the right place in the stack(ie. above SubSurf)
	Lock object transforms? Disable selectability?
	Make sure bones, objects, shapes, and object data are named properly.
	Make sure armature looks decent in all display modes. (no oversized envelopes or bbones, even with bone shapes disabled)
	Clean up bone shapes collection, maybe make a script to resize bones to a uniform scale and then adjust bone shape settings accordingly so they maintain their display size.
