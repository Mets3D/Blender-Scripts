Next week I plan to wrap up work on the body, which will include:
	- Maybe improve shoulder & elbow deformations if needed and have time to spare.
	- Apply the mirror modifier on the mesh, make sure rig is symmetrical, split up shape keys.
	- Add assymetrical shape keys for spine deformations (ie. Chest Z rotation)
	- Let Hjalti and Nacho fight it out on how they want controls to be displayed. (follow the deformation or not)
	- Write a document about how the rig is constructed, to give us some idea of what will be involved in applying the rig to another character.
		- Can also think about ways to automate as much of this process as possible.
		- This document will probably evolve a fair bit over time, until we get to a point where we actually want to start implementing the rig on a new character.

Rain Face Timeline
Some notes about the current state of each area of Rain's face rig:
	Eyes - (As far as I'm concerned) Basically done, just needs minor polish.
	Eyebrows - Almost done, but might need some adjustments or more low level controls, which could prove challenging, but imo these are non-essential improvements.
	Nose - As far as I'm concerned done, but didn't get feedback on it yet. I don't expect any challenges.
	Mouth - These areas need a lot of work and iteration.
		Lips & Cheeks - Not much functionality right now. Probably going to be the hardest part. I have some idea of what the animators want, but I expect there will be a lot of back and forth on this.
		Jaw - Works fairly well imo, but never showed it to animators yet. Just need to make sure it continues to work well while we're making changes to the lips & cheeks.

With these things in mind, here's my estimate of how long finishing the face might take:
Week 1: (hopefully starting Sept 23)
	- Rig teeth and tongue. I don't expect any issues or much need for iteration here.
	- Get feedback on jaw, eyes, eyebrows & nose so they can be finished.
Week 2:
	- Initial implementation of lip & cheek controls. (No shape keys yet) I expect lots of iteration needed for this.
Week 3: 
	- Implement feedback on eyes, eyebrows & nose, including shape keys where needed. Hopefully this is their final state.
	- Implement feedback on jaw. I expect this to be minimal... Major changes to this could be a big problem. Stashing the feedback away for the next project is always an option ;)
	- Add lattice controls. (More can be added any time, on demand.)
	- Some more work on lip & cheek controls, and gathering feedback.
Week 4-5:
	- Implement feedback on lip & cheek -> get feedback -> repeat many times.
	- Once we are fairly happy and are down to smaller changes, start adding shape keys.
	- Finalize lip & cheek controls.
Week 6:
	- More polish, mirror everything and make sure it doesn't break.

After the face is done, there is still some wrap-up work to do before we can call the entire rig finished.
Week 7-8:
	- Rigging the hair (if we need anything fancy, but this is probably non-essential.)
	- Rigging the clothes (this will be a bit tricky, since we can't transfer shape keys between meshes easily... I expect some unique problems...)
	- Final cleanup, making sure everything is consistently named, organized, WORKS, etc.
	- Ready to show to the world....??
	



I think I'll need a script to split shape keys into left/right parts and set up drivers accordingly. (I guess have the left-side driver on the original shape-key, then just flip that over to the new right side shape key)

I should make an addon to help the editing of shape keys and weights in any order.
	Let me weight paint after saving the geometry of a mesh with a certain shape key, then have an option to re-adjust the shape key with the new weights to give the same shape.
		It would be best if this could run on every brush stroke, but I guess that won't be possible.
	Figure out how to make it so that, in order to achieve a desired shape, the weights are re-distributed such that the least amount of work possible has to be done by shape keys, while everything else is done by bones.
		This seems super difficult, since bones can do a lot of things, like move, rotate, and scale, while shape keys can only move along a line.

Body/Limbs
	Apply mirror modifier and finalize thigh shape keys. Make sure the spine shape keys don't break also.
	
	Write a document about some of the challenges and improvements made over the past few weeks, include the videos.
	Write a document about how the rig could be replicated on a new character. What scripts need to be written, etc.

	HIGH DRV- bones should be deleted, and driven bones and shape keys should instead use the new Swing and rotation mode features.
		Still left: Knee, Foot, Elbow, Shoulder.
	HIGH We should never disable Inherit Rotation, because it breaks the functionality of the ROOT bone. Hinge settings need to use a Copy Transforms constraint targetting a mechanism bone.
	
	MEDIUM make script to auto-update magic numbers in elbow stretch drivers.
	MEDIUM Re-visit the elbow.
	MEDIUM Re-add double controls for Pelvis, Hips, and whatever else.

	LOW update spine construction script to latest version of the spine.

	NEXT RIG Stretch controls are kind of a total mess right now, especially when it comes to rotating them.
		The end of the shoulder and the start of the elbow being a separate toon control mean that the two controls are in the same place and overlap, so if we keep this, make sure to add unique bone shapes.
		Scaling any parent of STR-Elbow.L fucks up the IK stretching trick on it.
		LOW We could hook up the Y scale of stretch controls to the Ease In/Out values, the X and Z scale values to the Bbone X/Y In/Out scales, via drivers.
	NEXT RIG Rebuild Soft IK tech with Likkez's tech, see if we can't eliminate all downsides. If it works, Apply it to the arms too.

Clothes
	MEDIUM Come up with something to make the shirt not look glued to her skin.
		In the interest of time, it would be best to just embrace this, and use surface deform. This would mean being able to rig the clothes in 2 seconds.
		The alternative is spending somewhere north of 3 weeks on getting the clothes to deform as well as the body does.
		Or ask a developer to add masking to surface deform.

Face
	Add sneer control
	Add smile control

	Think about how to add more lower level control for the eyebrows.
	Add lattice controls for the head and the eye.
	Hook up the scale of CTR bones to the bbone scale of deform bones.

On release/updates
	Apply mirror modifier on the body and fix the UV islands where needed.
	Maybe join the UV layers into one? I don't like having them separate. I'd rather just offset them by 1 UV tile to the right.
	Make sure Armature modifiers are in the right place in the stack(ie. above SubSurf)
	Lock object transforms
	Make sure bones, objects, shapes, and object data are named properlyRNA_DEF_CURVEBONE_UPDATE
	Make sure bbone display size is consistent
	Clean up bone shapes collection, maybe make a script to resize bones to a uniform scale and then adjust bone shape settings accordingly so they maintain their display size.
