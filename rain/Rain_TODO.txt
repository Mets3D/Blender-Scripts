I should make an addon to help the editing of shape keys and weights in any order.
	Let me weight paint after saving the geometry of a mesh with a certain shape key, then have an option to re-adjust the shape key with the new weights to give the same shape.
		It would be best if this could run on every brush stroke, but I guess that won't be possible.
	Figure out how to make it so that, in order to achieve a desired shape, the weights are re-distributed such that the least amount of work possible has to be done by shape keys, while everything else is done by bones.
		This seems super difficult, since bones can do a lot of things, like move, rotate, and scale, while shape keys can only move along a line.

Write a document about some of the challenges and improvements made over the past few weeks, include the videos.
Write a document about how the rig could be replicated on a new character. What scripts need to be written, etc.
To make a rig generator, I need to learn how to use the new Rigify.

Write a document on what could be done on blender development side to make my workflow better, and what things I will need to learn and do in order to rig new characters.

Body/Limbs
	LOW FK-Thumb2.R rotation should affect palm bulge
	MEDIUM I think thigh might need some updates to be up to date with current shoulder tech. I wonder if its twist is managed(countered) correctly in IK mode.
	MEDIUM Improve shoulder deformation
	
	Scale propagation
		Knee, butt and shoulder deform correctives need to be replaced by shape keys.
			They are also currently parented to STR- bones, which is not necessarily bad but probably worth noting?
				The reason for this is because DEF- bones don't inherit scale, they get their scale from BBone scale, which can only be inherited by Armature Constraint, which works poorly for some reason.
					This does mean that we cannot parent anything to DEF- bones, which is not ideal.

	DONE Stretch controls are kind of a total mess right now, especially when it comes to rotating them.
		Scaling any parent of STR-Elbow.L fucks up the IK stretching trick on it.
		We could hook up the Y scale of stretch controls to the Ease In/Out values, the X and Z scale values to the Bbone X/Y In/Out scales, via drivers.

	NEXT RIG Re-add the Auto-Clavicle functionality.

Clothes
	HIGH Write a script to transfer shape keys from base mesh to the clothes with Surface Deform modifier. Also need to copy drivers, and then clean up weights and shape keys.
	MEDIUM Come up with something to make the shirt not look glued to her skin.

Face
		Keep in mind when re-generating face controls: Eyelids shouldn't affect eyerings, and eyebrows shouldn't affect themselves, that is to say, automatic bbone handle should be disabled on these areas. Same for lips.
		With that said, a lot of the bones from those areas should be able to be deleted.
	
	Maybe delete old action based eyering controls (and their relevant actions and constraints)?
	Delete unused face deform bones
	Delete unused auto+tangent helpers
	
	LOW (Kinda DONE?) Try to see if eyebrow GRP bones can behave a bit better when rotated, but not high priority.
	LOW Adjust weighting of the gums, such that they are weighted to face bones? Not sure about this... But I guess at least for the front area of the gums it could work and could be useful. Worth an experiment if we have the time.
	LOW MSTR-Eyering_Upper is an exposed control with a translating Action constraint... Not ideal, but not worth fixing for now.

	DONE Lip roll should affect the corners a lot less, and not aim for so much a kiss shape, but instead aim for just rolling the lips in whatever pose they're in.
	DONE It should roll over the teeth, so made with the assumption that it's used when the mouth is open. If we have time, can try to do something clever to make it work when the mouth is closed.
	DONE(maybe too much) LipWide action should squash the lips, to make them preserve volume.
	DONE? Make the nostrils react less to Lip_Wide and more to Lip_UpDown.

Final Cleanup
	We used to have some bones next to the ROOT bone that were used to organize bones that used Armature Constraint for parenting. What happened with that setup? I want it back.

	Find constraints that are disabled and remove them.
	Make sure no invalid constraints or drivers exist (and driver is not showing any warnings of any kind)
	Make script to nuke unnecessary curves in actions (performance boost).
	Set "dev" custom property on the rig to 0 to hide mech layers from the UI.
	Ensure UVs are fixed.
	Make sure Armature modifiers are in the right place in the stack(ie. above SubSurf)
	Lock object transforms? Disable selectability?
	Make sure bones, objects, shapes, object data and shape key blocks are named properly.
	Make sure armature looks decent in all display modes. (no oversized envelopes or bbones, even with bone shapes disabled)
	Clean up bone shapes collection, maybe make a script to resize bones to a uniform scale and then adjust bone shape settings accordingly so they maintain their display size.
