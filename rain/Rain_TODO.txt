I think I'll need a script to split shape keys into left/right parts and set up drivers accordingly. (I guess have the left-side driver on the original shape-key, then just flip that over to the new right side shape key)

Fiddle more with spine.
	Add upper chest control http://www.hippydrome.com/UpChestLRFB.html
	Re-do Waist and thigh deforms

Lower chest control
	Try offsetting the controls downwards from the deform bones, see how it works out.

Hinge settings need to use a Copy Transforms constraint targetting a mechanism bone which is parented to, I guess various things as an option.
	We should never disable Inherit Rotation, because it breaks the functionality of the ROOT bone.

Body/Limbs

	LOW Try making shoulder weights a bit broader.
		I don't know, it feels quite broad to me already.
	
	LOW Upper thigh is following knee pole vector too much.
		I don't think this can really be fixed easily.
	
	NEXT RIG Completely rework the way deformation adjusters are implemented. They need to stop relying on the local rotation of *anything* because that shit is unreliable. Rotation values in general should pretty much only drive anything if the thing doing the driving can only rotate on one axis, so, never. Because rotations are fucking weird.
		Instead, a stretch target should be parented to the joint, and the deform adjuster should stretch to that target. Then it's just a matter of parenting the deform adjuster itself appropriately.
		Or maybe try the muscle system addon.
	NEXT RIG Stretch controls are kind of a total mess right now, especially when it comes to rotating them.
		The end of the shoulder and the start of the elbow being a separate toon control mean that the two controls are in the same place and overlap, so if we keep this, make sure to add unique bone shapes.
		Scaling any parent of STR-Elbow.L fucks up the IK stretching trick on it.
		LOW We could hook up the Y scale of stretch controls to the Ease In/Out values, the X and Z scale values to the Bbone X/Y In/Out scales, via drivers.
	NEXT RIG Rebuild Soft IK tech with Likkez's tech, see if we can't eliminate all downsides. If it works, Apply it to the arms too.
	
Fingers
	LOW Add deform adjusters for fingers.
		
Clothes
	MEDIUM Shirt is wonky in the front and back when hips are moved
	MEDIUM Come up with something to make the shirt not look glued to her skin.

Face
	Add sneer control
	Add smile control

	Think about how to add more lower level control for the eyebrows.
	Add lattice controls for the head and the eye.
	Hook up the scale of CTR bones to the bbone scale of deform bones.

On release/updates
	Apply mirror modifier on the body and fix the UV islands where needed.
	Maybe join the UV layers into one? I don't like having them separate. I'd rather just offset them by 1 UV tile to the right.
	Make sure Armature modifiers are in the right place in the stack(ie. above SubSurf)
	Lock object transforms
	Make sure bones, objects, shapes, and object data are named properlyRNA_DEF_CURVEBONE_UPDATE
	Make sure bbone display size is consistent
	Clean up bone shapes collection, maybe make a script to resize bones to a uniform scale and then adjust bone shape settings accordingly so they maintain their display size.
