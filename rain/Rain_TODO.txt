Rain Face Timeline
Some notes about the current state of each area of Rain's face rig:
	Eyes - (As far as I'm concerned) Basically done, just needs minor polish.
	Eyebrows - Almost done, but might need some adjustments or more low level controls, which could prove challenging, but imo these are non-essential improvements.
	Nose - As far as I'm concerned done, but didn't get feedback on it yet. I don't expect any challenges.
	Mouth - These areas need a lot of work and iteration.
		Lips & Cheeks - Not much functionality right now. Probably going to be the hardest part. I have some idea of what the animators want, but I expect there will be a lot of back and forth on this.
		Jaw - Works fairly well imo, but never showed it to animators yet. Just need to make sure it continues to work well while we're making changes to the lips & cheeks.

With these things in mind, here's my estimate of how long finishing the face might take:
Week 1: (hopefully starting Sept 23)
	- Rig teeth and tongue. I don't expect any issues or much need for iteration here.
	- Get feedback on jaw, eyes, eyebrows & nose so they can be finished.
Week 2: (Sept 29)
	====Schedule offset by 2 days for scale discussions and fix===
	- Initial implementation of lip & cheek controls. (No shape keys yet) I expect lots of iteration needed for this.
Week 3: 
	- Implement feedback on eyes, eyebrows & nose, including shape keys where needed. Hopefully this is their final state.
	- Implement feedback on jaw. I expect this to be minimal... Major changes to this could be a big problem. Stashing the feedback away for the next project is always an option ;)
	- Add lattice controls. (More can be added any time, on demand.)
	- Some more work on lip & cheek controls, and gathering feedback.
Week 4-5:
	- Implement feedback on lip & cheek -> get feedback -> repeat many times.
	- Once we are fairly happy and are down to smaller changes, start adding shape keys.
	- Finalize lip & cheek controls.
Week 6:
	- More polish, mirror everything and make sure it doesn't break.

After the face is done, there is still some wrap-up work to do before we can call the entire rig finished.
Week 7-8:
	- Rigging the hair (if we need anything fancy, but this is probably non-essential.)
	- Rigging the clothes (this will be a bit tricky, since we can't transfer shape keys between meshes easily... I expect some unique problems...)
	- Final cleanup, making sure everything is consistently named, organized, WORKS, etc.
	- Ready to show to the world....??


I should make an addon to help the editing of shape keys and weights in any order.
	Let me weight paint after saving the geometry of a mesh with a certain shape key, then have an option to re-adjust the shape key with the new weights to give the same shape.
		It would be best if this could run on every brush stroke, but I guess that won't be possible.
	Figure out how to make it so that, in order to achieve a desired shape, the weights are re-distributed such that the least amount of work possible has to be done by shape keys, while everything else is done by bones.
		This seems super difficult, since bones can do a lot of things, like move, rotate, and scale, while shape keys can only move along a line.

Write a document about some of the challenges and improvements made over the past few weeks, include the videos.
Write a document about how the rig could be replicated on a new character. What scripts need to be written, etc.
To make a rig generator, I need to learn how to use the new Rigify.
Body/Limbs
	MEDIUM Improve shoulder & elbow deformation
	
	NEXT RIG Stretch controls are kind of a total mess right now, especially when it comes to rotating them.
		Scaling any parent of STR-Elbow.L fucks up the IK stretching trick on it.
		We could hook up the Y scale of stretch controls to the Ease In/Out values, the X and Z scale values to the Bbone X/Y In/Out scales, via drivers.

Clothes
	MEDIUM Come up with something to make the shirt not look glued to her skin.
	HIGH Write a script to transfer shape keys from base mesh to the clothes with Surface Deform modifier. Also need to copy drivers, and then clean up weights and shape keys.

Face
	DONE Make the eyebrow master behave more like a parent. Get rid of rotation-based action stuff. Middle eyebrow is not moving with the masters right now.
	DONE but I'm not sure if it's perfect?
		DONE Similar thing for the eye ring. Hide the current action-based thing away in case it will be useful, but possibly delete in the future.
	DONE For the eyelids, let it rotate along the forward axis. The CTR2/CONST bones should have a Limit Distance to stick it to the eye, and then an action should "rotate the eyelids".
	DONE Make lower eyering behave more parent-like than action-like, same as we did with the upper eyering.
	DONE Make the tweak bones for the eyebrow, eyering and eyelid bigger, and move them to a more prominent layer.
	
	DONE When eyebrows are pulled down, let the corners resist a little bit so the eyebrow makes a nicer shape when pulled down.
	
	DONE Eyering shouldn't be affected by the eyelid (turn off automatic tangent functionality on those columns of bbones, I guess?)
	
	>>>When the eyering and eyebrow are pulled down but the eyelid isn't, make sure it makes a clean shape.
	>>>The outer corner of the eyebrow should be able to go further before starting to break the mesh.
		I think this is actually a misinterpretation of the problem mentioned before it.
			Still left TODO on this: Any bones that are translated by actions should have CONST- bones (outer eyebrow), eyering should be moved mainly by the master, and then everything should be mirrored.

	Lattice controls should pivot from the center of the face(near lower eyelid)
	Top/Bottom latice controls should have more influence

	Try to see if eyebrow CTR can behave a bit better when rotated, but not high priority.
	DONE Make the eyebrow CTR bones aligned with the geometry just like we did on the lips.
	DONE Make the eyebrow master as well as the CTR bones tilted a bit, such that when they are moved on their local up axis, they behave according to the rule of thumb that says the eyebrows never move straight up or down. They should be tilted on both left-right and forward-back axes.
	
	Slap some simple shape keys in there to get the nose wrinkles and better eyebrow shapes, at least when moved with the master control.

	We want lattice-like controls with bones, so we can get similar behavior while still letting the controls not become disconnected.
	There would be two of these, one for the upper and one for the lower face. The upper would not affect the nose but the lower would.
	There should be a CTR- bone for the nose bridge.


	Improve visuals of CTR2-Nose_Main (make a shape, make it yellow, rename to MSTR-Nose, make it orient with the nose with a DSP- bone)


	Add sneer control?

	LOW 
	
	Add lattice and lattice-like master bone controls for the eye.


	NEXT RIG Hook up the scale of CTR bones to the bbone scale of deform bones.
	NEXT RIG Think about how to add more lower level control for the eyebrows.

On release/updates
	Make script to nuke unnecessary curves in actions (performance boost).
	Set "dev" custom property on the rig to 0 to hide mech layers from the UI.
	Fix UVs if they weren't already?
	Make sure Armature modifiers are in the right place in the stack(ie. above SubSurf)
	Lock object transforms? Disable selectability?
	Make sure bones, objects, shapes, and object data are named properly.
	Make sure armature looks decent in all display modes. (no oversized envelopes or bbones, even with bone shapes disabled)
	Clean up bone shapes collection, maybe make a script to resize bones to a uniform scale and then adjust bone shape settings accordingly so they maintain their display size.
