I should make an addon to help the editing of shape keys and weights in any order.
	Let me weight paint after saving the geometry of a mesh with a certain shape key, then have an option to re-adjust the shape key with the new weights to give the same shape.
		It would be best if this could run on every brush stroke, but I guess that won't be possible.
	Figure out how to make it so that, in order to achieve a desired shape, the weights are re-distributed such that the least amount of work possible has to be done by shape keys, while everything else is done by bones.
		This seems super difficult, since bones can do a lot of things, like move, rotate, and scale, while shape keys can only move along a line.

Write a document about some of the challenges and improvements made over the past few weeks, include the videos.
To make a rig generator, I need to learn how to use the new Rigify.

HIGH Write a document on what could be done on blender development side to make my workflow better, and what things I will need to learn and do in order to rig new characters.
HIGH Write a document about how the rig could be replicated on a new character. What scripts need to be written, etc.

CLOUDRIGIFY
	Differences from usual Rigify:
		All UI elements should be displayed at all times, just like Rain.
	Differences from Rain:
		Rigify's operator-based parent switching and IK/FK switching/snapping should be used.
	
	Ideas:
		Should probably turn constraints into a class. At least it would let us more easily add drivers to them.
		I should implement a CollectionProperty-like class, for ID collections, similar to BoneInfoContainer.
		BoneInfo and other ID classes could perhaps live without all their values pre-assigned in __init__. The only ones that need to be pre-assigned are the ones that other things rely on, like how the length property relies on head and tail existing.
		I really need to make sure I can justify abstracting the entire set of blender rigging related datastructures... it feels really silly.

	Next up:
		Spine
		Neck and head? Is this separate from the spine?
		Face... Q_Q
		Implement something very similar to Rigify's super_copy rig, which would allow adding constraints, changing the position and display properties of a generated bone. But it wouldn't create it from scratch, like Rigify's current super-copy.

		Complicate the hand a bit more.
	
	Could eventually refactor all of the code to be a bit more compliant with Rigify's coding style - Maybe even abandon our abstractions.

Body/Limbs
	HIGH Pablico found a pose in which the spine starts twisting out like crazy for a small amount of degrees. I couldn't reproduce, and he said it wasn't important, but it would still be nice to know what causes it.

	LOW FK-Thumb2.R rotation should affect palm bulge (This might be fixed, I reckon it was that .rength mirroring issue)
	
	Scale propagation
		Knee, butt and shoulder deform correctives need to be replaced by shape keys.
			They are also currently parented to STR- bones, which is not necessarily bad but probably worth noting?
				The reason for this is because DEF- bones don't inherit scale, they get their scale from BBone scale, which can only be inherited by Armature Constraint, which works poorly in this case for some reason.
					This does mean that we cannot parent anything to DEF- bones, which is not ideal.

		
	NEXT RIG Re-add the Auto-Clavicle functionality.

Clothes
	MEDIUM Come up with something to make the shirt not look glued to her skin.

Face
	HIGH Action Constraint fix is now in master, so delete CTR-P- or whatever-they-are-now bones, and rename action curves with script while trying not to break anything.
		Keep in mind when re-generating face controls: Eyelids shouldn't affect eyerings, and eyebrows shouldn't affect themselves, that is to say, automatic bbone handle should be disabled on these areas. Same for lips.
		With that said, a lot of the bones from those areas should be able to be deleted.
	
	Eye
		Bring back eye dot (Add a bone for it)
		Add Eye render/dummy switch
		Add dilate controls
		Merge body and head

	Some more detailed controls for the ears.

	Forehead deform bones shouldn't be affected by eyebrow controls (disable aim constraints on TAN-AIM bones)

	Maybe delete old action based eyering controls (and their relevant actions and constraints)?
	Delete unused face deform bones
	Delete unused auto+tangent helpers
	
	LONG TERM Maybe lip corner can be oriented to the curvature of the lip so when moved on local Z the mouth corner doesnt have to be manually pushed in by the animator, but can still be adjusted.

	LOW Try weighting the gums to the face bones? Not sure about this... But I guess at least for the front area of the gums it could work and could be useful. Worth an experiment if we have the time.
	LOW MSTR-Eyering_Upper is an exposed control with a translating Action constraint... Not ideal, but not worth fixing for now.

Final Cleanup
	We used to have some bones next to the ROOT bone that were used to organize bones that used Armature Constraint for parenting. What happened with that setup? I want it back.

	Find constraints that are disabled and remove them.
	Make sure no invalid constraints or drivers exist (and driver is not showing any warnings of any kind)
	DONE Make script to nuke unnecessary curves in actions (performance boost).
	Set "dev" custom property on the rig to 0 to hide mech layers from the UI.
	Ensure UVs are fixed.
	Make sure Armature modifiers are in the right place in the stack(ie. above SubSurf)
	Lock object transforms? Disable selectability?
	Make sure bones, objects, shapes, object data and shape key blocks are named properly.
	Make sure armature looks decent in all display modes. (no oversized envelopes or bbones, even with bone shapes disabled)
	Clean up bone shapes collection, maybe make a script to resize bones to a uniform scale and then adjust bone shape settings accordingly so they maintain their display size.
